# Your Projects — What's Real, What's Brewing, What's a Dream

## Active Projects (you've done actual work on these)

### 1. Project Zero
**What it is:** Your meta-project. A "system for life" — capture thoughts, extract meaning, organize by project, eventually generate software/content from thoughts alone.
**Status:** Raw thought capture works. Extraction pipeline works via Cursor rules. Basic website exists. Story generation works.
**Energy level:** High passion, low output. Lots of vision documents, not much shipped product.
**Honest take:** This is your heart project but also your biggest trap. It keeps expanding in scope every time you think about it. More on this in the third doc.

### 2. Mridhu by Elsa
**What it is:** Wife's online fashion/bedsheet business. Selling sourced products via Instagram + Shopify.
**Status:** Shopify site live with 1 product. Razorpay KYC done. Instagram page exists. Domain connected. Some product photos taken (dining table, night, not great). Logo generated.
**What's actually blocking:** Product photography/videography. That's it. Everything else is set up or can be set up in hours.
**Honest take:** This is the project most likely to generate revenue soonest. The remaining work is concrete and finite — shoot products properly, list them, tell people. You've been circling around the photography step because it involves showing up visually and being judged. But Elsa has the eye for fashion and an iPhone 17 Pro Max. Shoot 5 bedsheets in natural light on a bed. Upload. Done. Stop optimizing the process and just do the first batch ugly.

### 3. SVK English Classes (YouTube)
**What it is:** Your father's English teaching YouTube channel.
**Status:** Video editing workflow exists via Google Drive. At least one editor onboarded.
**What's blocking:** Editing pace is slow. You've thought about finding more editors (Upwork, freelancers) but haven't acted.
**Honest take:** This is a support project, not your main thing. Keep it running but don't let it consume creative energy. The Google Drive workflow is good enough. Post an Upwork job for a Malayalam+English video editor. Set a per-video rate. Move on.

### 4. Matrimony PDF Maker
**What it is:** Mobile-first tool to create matrimony profile PDFs. No backend, client-side only.
**Status:** Phase 1 partially built. Working prototype that surprised you with quality. GitHub repo exists.
**Honest take:** This is your most shippable project right now. It works. It solves a real, recurring problem (you've been asked to make these profiles multiple times). It needs maybe 2-3 days of work to be genuinely useful. Ship it. Share it. See what happens. This could also be your portfolio piece.

## Brewing Projects (you've thought about them seriously but haven't started)

### 5. Document Builder
**What it is:** A generalized version of the matrimony PDF maker. Upload a photo of any form → get an editable, AI-assisted document builder.
**Origin:** Came from the insight during matrimony PDF development that people need all kinds of structured PDFs — invoices, warranties, profiles, bills.
**Honest take:** Good idea. But finish the matrimony maker first. That's your proof of concept. Don't generalize before you've shipped the specific thing.

### 6. Jithu's YouTube Channel
**What it is:** Personal channel showing how you build things, daily life capture, possibly music.
**Status:** Zero videos. Still debating Malayalam vs English, one channel vs multiple.
**Honest take:** You're overthinking the format. Record yourself building something for 30 minutes. Post it. That's video #1. The format will emerge from doing, not from planning. Language: whatever feels natural when you press record.

### 7. Video Editing Pipeline/Platform
**What it is:** Platform connecting video producers and editors with clean file sharing, instructions, payments.
**Status:** Idea only.
**Honest take:** This is a real business idea but requires significant product work. Park it. Revisit when you have revenue from something else and can invest time properly.

### 8. Notes App
**What it is:** Simple, cheap alternative to Obsidian. Free for one device, $1 for multi-device sync.
**Status:** Idea only. Some tension about whether to build this before or after the thought tracker.
**Honest take:** There are a thousand notes apps. Unless you have a truly different angle (and you might, given your thoughts-first philosophy), this is low priority. Keep using Obsidian for now.

### 9. Thought Tracker (public product)
**What it is:** A version of your personal thought capture system that others can use.
**Status:** The personal version works (text files + extraction rules). No public product.
**Honest take:** This could be genuinely unique. But it needs the privacy system figured out first, and a simpler onboarding story. Not now, but keep collecting learnings from your own usage.

## Life Projects (not software, but taking real mental space)

### 10. House
**What it is:** Camera installation, electrical work, mosquito nets, AC maintenance, bedroom organization, walking pad, monitor setup.
**Honest take:** These are maintenance tasks disguised as a "project." Batch them. Pick one weekend. Hire the electrician. Order the mosquito stuff. Done. Don't let these live in your head rent-free alongside Project Zero.

### 11. Music / Songs
**What it is:** You want to record and post songs. Someone once commented "saadhakam" (roughly: "you have talent, keep practicing").
**Honest take:** This is a pull, not a project yet. When it's ready, it'll come. Don't force it into a system. Maybe just record one song on your phone and post it somewhere. See how it feels.

## The Honest Priority Stack

If I had to rank these by "most likely to move your life forward in the next 30 days":

1. **Mridhu** — Shoot products, list them, make the first sale. Revenue + wife's happiness + proof you can execute.
2. **Matrimony PDF Maker** — 2-3 days to finish and ship. Portfolio piece + potentially useful to many people.
3. **Project Zero (scoped down)** — Not the grand vision. Just: make the daily thought capture smoother, maybe build the simplest possible dynamic version.
4. **SVK YouTube** — Post the Upwork job for editors. 30 minutes of work.
5. Everything else — Park it. Write the idea down. Come back in a month.

## Pattern Across Projects

You start things. You get them to 60-70%. Then you start something else. The matrimony maker is at 60%. Mridhu is at 60%. Project Zero is at... 30% of a 30% scoped version.

The compound returns come from the last 30%. That's where "interesting prototype" becomes "thing people use." That's where the learning happens. That's where the money is.

Finish things.
