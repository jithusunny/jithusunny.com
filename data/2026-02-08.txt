I think we are complicating things too much for now.

For the moment, I want to keep the source as simple as possible.
No IDs, no links, no splitting, no metadata.

Just start time, end time, and raw thought text.
Everything written within a time range is one thought — one box.

We can always split later.
We can always add IDs later.
We can always add structure later.

Right now, the most important thing is to capture thoughts easily, without friction.
I should be able to write this in a plain text editor, WhatsApp self chat, or notes app.

This plain text should be the source of truth.
All other layers — IDs, links, structure, views — should be derived from this later.
