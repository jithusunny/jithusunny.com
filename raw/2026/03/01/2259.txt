Got the code generation pipeline a little more better(hopefully) with the help of chatgpt

We have a blueprint step now in between spec and tasks.

From chatgpt:
Raw thoughts
   ↓
Spec        (what the software is)
   ↓
Blueprint   (what parts exist)
   ↓
Tasks       (how to build those parts this iteration)
   ↓
Build       (generate code)

For now this is what we have done, chatGPT gave detailed prompts to do the above workflow.

It also suggested more stuff that will come in later.
