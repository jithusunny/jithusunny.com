A couple of minor changes I'd like:
1. I dont like scrolling. Have only 7 thoughts in the listing
2. Have a back button on left top to go back to the previous state when we go into a thoguht. Right now we can only go back to home. So we cant go to 3rd page or something if we went into thought details from there.
3. Let's have an appropriate .gitignore file for the project.


I also brainstormed with chatgpt how to improve the efficiency of the regeneration part.
I was thinking I can reuse code across iterations, but that will increase the input token load.
So ChatGPT suggested a better looking approach with blueprints, architecture graphs, invariants ,etc e.total_count

Sounds great.

Going to go there step by step.

First adding a blueprint generation in the workflow.
