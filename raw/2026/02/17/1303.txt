Okay, now let's create a shopify site for mridhu.in

I think I need to use Elsa's email for the same.
Or let's create a new email for mridhu business: mridhubyelsa@gmail.com
or should I create care@mridhu.in?
or how about I create mridhubyelsa@gmail.com and use care@mridhu.in for that?

Let me check with ChatGPT.

Plan ready:

Email + Shopify plan (crisp journal bullets)

1. Create mridhubyelsa@gmail.com
 - Use as Shopify owner login
 - Use for recovery, payments, Meta, admin

2. Create care@mridhu.in
 - Customer-facing email (site, orders, packaging)

3. Set email forwarding
 - care@mridhu.in → mridhubyelsa@gmail.com
 - Done via domain provider (no cost)

4. Configure Gmail
 - Add Send mail as: care@mridhu.in
 - Reply to customers from care@ address

5. Shopify signup
 - Sign up with mridhubyelsa@gmail.com
 - Store name: Mridhu by Elsa
 - Country: India | Currency: INR

6. Shopify settings (immediately after signup)
 - Contact email: care@mridhu.in
 - Sender email: care@mridhu.in
 - Keep Shopify default domain as backup

7. Domain
 - Connect mridhu.in to Shopify later
 - Don’t delete existing DNS until verified

8. Principle
 - Gmail = control & safety
 - Domain email = brand trust
 - Upgrade to Workspace later if needed
