Updated the rule with the help of ChatGPT to make summaries story like and also added overall story thing too.

Also updated html to keep main story at the home page.

At some point, it would be nice to be able to have google maps style zoom in/out on the story - verbosity increases/decreases.
Can also add some handy shortcut/gesture like hold Alt key and mouse wheel, etc.

So people can adjust the story length as they like.
