Want to make the transcription flow smooth.

Bought Easy recorder app pro version for now

Setup autosave to Gogole drive


Next going to setup the automation to transcribe recordings using AssemblyAI and notify.

ChatGPT says:
Use Make until it annoys you.
When it annoys you, move to n8n.
Only build custom when n8n annoys you.

Will continue later, feeling sleepy.

Also, should I just have gotten some app that does all of this?
Is okay, I can use individual pieces going forward, etg: AssemblyAI, make.com, etc.....
