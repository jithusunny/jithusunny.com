Came back after lunch and getting Elsa from office.

Hoped to see the transcription process complete in AssemblyAI.
But this error message greeted me: Server Error, developers have been alerted.

Trying again.

Did not work.

Going for GCP.

Setup autopay on jithusunny-com billing account using jithusunnyk@gmail.com google accoutn for gcp using debit card 2***
Enabled speech to text api
create project jithusunny-com
created bucket jithusunny-com 
created stt workspace jithusunny-com

Converted m4a to mp3 using cloudconvert.com


Turns out the issue was file format.
Also GCP output was paying more attention to the phonetic accuracy, hence I got transcripts like this:
"I dont want Tu fake i m doing all dis for myself Fame Mani and all that"

AssemblyAI gave what I wanted:
"I don't want to - I don't want to fake. I'm doing all this for myself. Fame, money, and all that."

Maybe we can get GCP to do the same if I tweak, but at this stage I don't want to research this more.
Going with AssemblyAI for now.

Got the two thought sessions from 13/02 transcribed and added here!

Deleted GCP bucket, project, disabled API.

AssemblyAI for now.
