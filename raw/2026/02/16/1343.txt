Let me check with chatgpt and all what the best tool for transcription is (duration, quality, cost, convenience, api, etc.)

Also may be I will upload the audio to Google drive and keep it linked to the corresponding thought.

Added audio files to Projects/Project Zero/Audio thoughts/2026/02/13

No other link required, it will be easy to link the audio-thought via file path.
May be just indicate in the text file, that this is a transcript.

Summary of chat with ChatGPT on this:

Transcription choice: AssemblyAI

Why:
- Handles long files (1–10 hrs, large sizes) without splitting or failures
- High-quality Indian English transcription even with traffic/construction noise
- Cloud-based, scalable, easy now and API-ready later
- Low cost (~₹12–₹22/hour) with predictable billing
- Reasonable security posture (encrypted, documented retention)

Alternatives considered:
- OpenAI Speech-to-Text — excellent accuracy, but file-size limits add operational friction
- Google Cloud Speech-to-Text — reliable, but higher cost and setup overhead

Okay getting transcription done using AssemblyAI now.


I'm feeling a wave of relief after taking action. It works!!!
I just had to get up from that rock I sat thinking thinking and thinking and just take a few steps towards the direction it felt right!
It works!

Will go have lunch and come back.
