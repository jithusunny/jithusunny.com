Got the payment part setup completely - now UPI, netbanking, wallets are also supported in addition to cards.
Still card payment is the main, default option on checkout page.
For UPI and all people have to click away into a hosted Razorpay page - raised a support ticket to know if there's a way to show UPI and all in checkout page itself.

Also tried orders - checkout, order, refund, etc etc. - all seems to be working perfect!

Took 1 hour for all this work.

Next on mridhu is adding more products, polishing the shopify site looks, getting product video edited by an editor.

We would also need to assess the situation on packing side once more - will ahv to buy the brown bag. THe one we bought earleir was small, Elsa returned it.
It may also help if we get a label printer kinda thing - can use it to create label/stickers for home organization as well.
Can also use it to print quick notes - like a zettelkasten, etc.

One other thing is to check with the DTDC office nearby about the shipping rates.

Then we need to decide on pricing, shipping charge, etc.
