Let me add the new photos and videos that we shot of 2 bedsheets for Mridhu in mridhu.in


Faced some issues while converting heic locally in laptop itself.
Tried online converters, they had some limits, etc. also not very convenient.
Wanted a commandline way.

Added note in mridhu docs about issues faced, and commands to convert heic to jpg and mov to mp4.
It took 80 minutes to figure all this out!

Next is adding product details for the new bedsheet, I will give the previous bedsheet's content and new bedsheet image to generate metadata using ChatGPT
Done in 20 minutes

Next is finishing the payment setup
15 minutes and done, tried a test payment, then archived order.
Enabled real payments!

But I see only cards supported by Razorpay.
Need to check how to support UPI or no one will buy.

Updated theme to whisper. Need to configure things properly in it next.
