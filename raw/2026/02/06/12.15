Shared these thoughts with ChatGPT.

Let's say I’m having a stream of consciousness thing documented.
How to link to each thought?
Sometimes thoughts keep growing and growing and growing, get interspersed with each other, links to stories, personal, imagination, etc., etc.
I want the raw thing to be captured and then see the different things separately, clearly, but interlinked as suitable.
What to do when I’m having a train of thought for 5 minutes?
I ideally want them atomically so that I can link to and from and all that.

Soon we will have events also streamed into this.
So basically I will soon grow this into something where I connect my raw thoughts to, and it will be the raw/truth captured that is the base of everything.
I’m not sure if an event happened (e.g., I brushed my teeth) should also be a thought or should be captured as an event?
It might be good for uniformity’s sake if we keep everything a thought.
Or maybe having events separate from thoughts is better.
Maybe we can have both events and thoughts and base things in the system?
