I need a way to mark things private and public with access levels later.

I already feel I'm censoring myself due to the fact that I am not comfortable putting some sensitive/private matters out there.
For example, if I freely put what I feel about someone's work situation their employer get hurt and could sue me.
Same for any situation of conflict that involves other people. 

But I definitely need my thoughts about all that to be fed into this system, and reflected upon. That area is a gold mine - 
my thoughts about all that can make more patterns clear about me. Some situation could be considered a project in its own right.
That involves tracking what is happening, preparing documents, reading/researching, etc. etc.

Other competing directions pulling me right now:
- create and release a first version of thought tracker that people can use. Something needs to be there that I can show to people that also makes sense to people, that also resembles some product.
But this requires a lot of thought on privacy, safety, migration, etc etc. Once people start using it, it will be hard to change as data migration will be involved.
To still move superfast, we have to keep things simple, sensible, radically minimal and follow rules/principles, etc.
- any software that I create should not be things that takes a lot of time to maintain. It should just be a translation of thoughts, preferences, decisions, etc. I should be able to generate the code for that without any trouble.
Ofcourse that kind of a workflow requires some thought, iterations, etc. etc. But only that mode is sustainable in the long run. Or code will rot, making our lives also rot.
- document builder(a more general version of matrimony maker) is actually useful relevant in the present. I felt the pain of having to manually edit the document, compare the previous/after after each ChatGPT edit, etc. while working with some document these days.
That can be specialised for each domain - legal, software, architeture, etc. etc. - will be a great help for people.
- the pace in which SVK youtube video editing is being done needs to increase. Thoughts of checking Upwork for the same occurred to me. We would need malayalee editors as the video language is English + Malayalam. It should not be a big trouble to onboard people as we have past videos in/out thing and Gdrive workflow setup already done.
The difficulty is in deciding the fee per video. How about I ask the current editor his opinion on this? Will he be comfortable answering that? If not I can consult some other video editing freelancer. How to find such people?
- the video editing thing is required for Elsa's Mridhu product videos as well. In fact that is the next main step that we need to do to continue moving.
- the things that needs to be done at home also keeps coming up once in a while: need to buy something to prevent mosquitos from getting through th bottom gap of doors, need to get the things to be done with Electrician like LED strip at kitchen, plug point for Robocleaner to free up extension, leaking pipes in bathrooms, replace stands in bathrooms, etc.
- Google drive cleanup - not urgent. But would give me some peace to see things in order
- Cleanup of bedroom almirah left most column
- Prune dresses to move more dress that I wont be using from formal dress set to things to be moved to Ollur/
- Move packed dress that I wont be using to Ollur home
- Have a way to start recording some songs and post in site, and later as videos in youtube. Keep the saadhakam comment from some compsciz-gec in mind while doing this. Need some salt in life.
- Start youtube videos in the way I keep thinking - like a building being built with bricks and other stuff - any topic or project or concept, etc. can be explained with a set of interdepending atomic note videos.
Soon we could have videos on certain topics autogenerated from atomic notes. I think the equivalent thing needs to be done for notes before going to videos.
But dont be blocked completely, can try some small videos still.
- Decide on what to do with the walking pad. Still haven't gotten into a workflow where I use that.
- Decide on what to do with the very wide monitor I got. Not using it at all, simply there on my table wasting space. Might be useful if I have to visualize a lot of things, or hve a big canvas of things at some point or edit audio/video.
But otherwise it is a waste. I'm also getting strain on my eyes since the laptop is away from my eyes. Need to do something ASAP.
- Get uncle's old iPhone reset and given back.
- Need to charge iPad, install ezycam+ in it, and login to jithu's account so that anybody at home can use that to monitor baby without needinf my phone.
- Need to get WABA number for Mridhu and update it in all places
- Need to shoot videos/photos the right way for initial Mridhu products.
- So some projects can be public. Some can be private. But even for a public project, some raw/atomic thoughts may have to be marked private. This already brings in complexity: how will we do that smoothly,
how to mark who can see what easily. When thoughts are the basis of everything above it, how can the more visible outer layers be built without revealing some of the private building blocks for it to others?
etc etc. May be we can mask or something - this needs to be figured out. But I think I'm going into disproportioante amount of research at the moment.

I need to find the most suitable thing to do next and jsut start moving.
