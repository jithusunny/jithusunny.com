I have been requested to create a matrimony profile for someone. I have created one for myself in the past, for others as well. This is a recurring thing. Somebody is thinking how to create a PDF file for profile today. I can create a profile generator thing, that can make this process easy.

Got this vision and spec for the same formatted with ChatGPT:

Vision
Build the fastest, simplest mobile-first tool to create a clean, socially correct matrimony profile PDF through structured input, voice, or file upload — with instant preview, mandatory confirmation of extracted data, and zero formatting effort required from the user.

Spec
Single-page web app that generates a matrimony profile PDF in real time.

Core Features
- Always-visible live preview of the final PDF.
- Structured field input (fixed schema).
- Hold-to-speak voice input → transcribe → extract fields → require confirmation before commit.
- Image upload (profile photo).
- Any data from voice/free text/file → system displays: Field: Value Confirm? [Yes] [Edit]
- No auto-commit.
- Every confirmed change regenerates the PDF instantly.
- No accounts, no storage.
- No backend (direct LLM API calls from frontend).
- Client-side PDF generation.

Output
- Clean, traditional, print-ready PDF.
- Single-page default, auto-expand if needed.

V2
- Upload existing profile PDF → extract → map to schema → edit → regenerate.
