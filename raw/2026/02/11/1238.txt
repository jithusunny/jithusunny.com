Got the vision, spec and workflow polished with ChatGPT:

Vision
Build a mobile-first, document-centric matrimony profile creator that converts natural conversation into a clean, socially correct, print-ready profile — with explicit user control, reversible changes, and zero formatting friction.

Product Spec (v1)
1. Core Model
- Single structured JSON state represents entire profile.
- Live HTML document renders directly from state.
- PDF export mirrors preview exactly.
- All mutations are explicit and reversible.

2. Layout
Mobile (Primary)
- 90% scrollable document preview.
- Minimal floating bottom bar: Undo, Redo, Speak, Edit, Export.
- All editing in bottom-sheet modal.
- No visible forms or side panels.

Desktop
- Centered A4-style preview.
- Floating controls only.
- No sidebars.
- Document always dominates interface.

3. Editing & AI
- Inline Editing
- Tap field → open editor.
- Options: Manual Edit | AI Edit.

AI Rules
- AI returns structured diffs only (field.path → value).
- No auto-commit.
- User can Approve All, Approve Individually, Reject All.
- AI cannot rewrite layout or entire document.

4. Confirmation
- Mandatory confirmation for:
- Voice extraction
- Free text extraction
- File extraction
- AI edits
- Display Field path:
  - Old value (if applicable)
  - Proposed value: No silent mutations.

5. Undo / Redo
- Snapshot-based history.
- Minimum 30 steps.
- Applies to all confirmed mutations.
- Full-state restoration.

6. Rendering Rules
- Clean, minimal typography.
- Generous spacing.
- No visual clutter.
- Auto-expand vertically.
- Preview and PDF visually identical.

7. Architecture (v1)
- Static frontend.
- Direct LLM API calls.
- Client-side PDF generation.
- No backend.
- No auth.
- No storage.

Iterative Build Workflow
- Define Vision + Spec.
- Cursor generates task breakdown from Spec.
- Cursor generates code for tasks.
- You test.
- You collect feedback (behavioral, UX, edge cases).
- Update Vision + Spec by appending “Iteration Update” section.
- Provide Cursor:
  - Updated Vision + Spec (including updates)
  - Previous task list
  - Existing codebase
- Cursor generates next iteration tasks only.
- Repeat.

Rules:
- Spec is source of truth.
- Code must always reflect Spec.
- Updates are additive unless explicitly marked as replacement.
- No feature drift outside Spec.
