Got the vision, spec and workflow polished with ChatGPT:

Vision
Build a mobile-first, document-centric matrimony profile creator that evolves in phases — starting as a clean, editable living document and progressively adding AI assistance — while preserving user control, clarity, reversibility, and visual simplicity at every stage.

Product Specification
Core Architectural Model (Applies to All Phases)
- Entire profile stored as a single structured JSON state.
- Live HTML document renders directly from state.
- PDF export mirrors preview exactly.
- All state mutations are explicit and reversible.
- Snapshot-based undo/redo (minimum 30 steps).
- No visual clutter. Document always dominates UI.

Rendering Rules
- HTML-based preview.
- A4 proportions.
- Generous spacing.
- Minimal typography hierarchy.
- No dense blocks.
- Auto-expand vertically (never compress to force single page).
- Preview and PDF must match visually.

Architecture
- Static frontend.
- Single JSON state object.
- Snapshot history arrays.
- Client-side PDF export.
- Direct LLM API calls when needed
- No backend.
- No persistent storage.

Phase 1 — Living Document Editor
Objective: Make the editing experience perfect without AI.

Features
1. Layout
- Mobile: 90% scrollable A4-style preview.
- Minimal floating bottom bar: Undo, Redo, Edit, Export.
- All edits via bottom-sheet modal.
- No visible form panels.

2. Editing

- Tap any field → bottom-sheet editor.
- Manual editing only.
- On save:
    - Push snapshot to history.
    - Re-render preview.

3. Export
- PDF export matches preview exactly.

Phase 2 — Voice AI
Objective: Reduce typing friction while preserving control.

Features
1. AI Scope
- Triggered only from a specific field.
- Voice-only AI editing.
- AI may propose changes only for active field (unless user explicitly allows multi-field extraction).

2. Flow
- Tap field → AI Edit → Hold-to-speak.
- Transcription displayed live.
- AI returns structured diff:
  - field.path → proposed_value
- User must confirm.
- On confirm:
 - Snapshot pushed.
- State updated.
- Voice mode ends.

3. Confirmation Rules
- No auto-commit.
- Show old value → proposed value.

4. Undo / Redo
- Snapshot-based.
- Applies to every confirmed change.

Phase 3 — Document Upload
Objective: Allow importing existing profiles safely.

Features
1. Upload
- Accept PDF/image.
- Extract text.
- AI maps text to schema.

2. Confirmation
- Show structured diff (batch + individual approval).
- No silent merge.

3. State Update
- Only after explicit confirmation.
- Snapshot-based.


Iterative Development Workflow

Development Loop (Per Phase)
1. Vision + Spec define scope.
2. Cursor generates task list for current active phase only.
3. Cursor generates code for those tasks.
4. You test (mobile first).
5. You document feedback as:
 - Observed behavior
 - Desired behavior
6. Append feedback as “Iteration Update” under active phase.
7. Provide Cursor:
 - Updated Vision + Spec (with iteration updates appended)
 - Previous task list
 - Current codebase
8. Cursor generates next iteration tasks (for same phase).
9. Repeat until Phase Gate is satisfied.
10. Unlock next phase.
