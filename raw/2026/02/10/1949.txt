This is all public. Not many people reading this, probably just me now.

But because anybody can, I may not open up fully.

I think I need a way to mark thoughts public/private (or specific people later on).

For now I will just avoid putting private stuff in this. 
I would love to keep the raw thoughts also public when possible, why hide?

But some things have to be private.

Okay, we will come back to this.
