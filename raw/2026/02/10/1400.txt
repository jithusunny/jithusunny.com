Thoughts from brainstorming with ChatGPT 

I want to pick up stuff from these thoughts and move them into lists/buckets so that I can see the things happening in my mind more clearly.

Also, right now I'm just putting thoughts in .txt files to not tie the data itself to this system I'm building.

The things that are derived from the raw thoughts—like the lists/buckets/graph or whatever—can reside in a server or DB or whatever. That also needs to be one-click exportable to an easy, universal format. That is another thing, but the point is: we want the next level that sits on top of these raw thoughts also to be somewhat plain, simple, etc., not too complex. Still we can use any fundamental data structure/format or whatever.

Let's follow these for now:
1. Let raw thoughts be immutable.
2. Have a short pass over raw thoughts and extract thoughts.
3. Have the same folder structure as raw for thoughts as well. One thought per file
4. In thought file have thought, tags, source
5. For tags, don't overdo. ASk "how would I want to get this thought back?".
6. For extraction, don't overdo. Ask "If I forget this, is something important lost?"
7. Thoughts missed to extract, tags missed to add - is fine. Can do later.

Capture raw → extract what has charge → label lightly → repeat.
