Looks like the code generation is done, cursor also did some testing.

Some feedback for the next iteration:
You said in chat response:
cd projects/project-zero/app
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --reload

1. we better install deps in a virtualenv? in the next iteration please follow that and such best practices
2. Also when I run app, I got Address already in use error. Next time, please make shutdown and cleanup proper once you test.
