Next, let's have a task tracker based on the spec current version.

It should include all the things that cursor will ahve to do to turn the spec into a working software that I can look at readme and setup and use.

Keep it in projects/project-zero/tasks/current.txt

The app code should go into projects/project-zero/app/

Also give a prompt that I can give next to tell cursor to use that tasks list and go ahead and build the software.
The prompt should instruct cursor to add any helpful notes to each task it performs in the task tracker file.
This will help in the future iterations. For example, anything that may not be clear by looking at the code/comments itself, can be put in the task notes - not a separate file.
Same tasks file, under the respective task -if any, dont force.

Ideally code should be readbale and sufficnet to undertand what is happening.
Task notes is about, some why/what about the process of generating/organizing the code - not about the logic/architecture of the code.

So in next iterations, if required, these can be referred to get more context on how the current version was generated, etc.
