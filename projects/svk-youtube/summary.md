# SVK YouTube

## Story so far
SVK English Classes is a YouTube channel run by the author's father. There's already a working process: recorded videos go to an editor via Google Drive, the editor sends back the finished video and thumbnail. It works well enough, but there's friction. The desire is to simplify the handoff, bring on more editors so more videos can be produced, and drive down the per-video editing cost.

There's also an idea floating around to build a simple website for the workflow — something that could sit on top of Google Drive itself and make the whole coordination lighter. Nothing has been built yet, but the need is felt.

By mid-February, the pace problem became more concrete. The video editing throughput needs to increase. Upwork came to mind as a place to find Malayalam+English video editors. The tricky part is deciding the per-video fee — one approach is to ask the current editor for their take, another is to consult a freelancer outside the loop.

## Timeline
- **Feb 10** — Described the current Google Drive-based video editing workflow. Noted the desire to onboard more editors, simplify the process, and reduce costs. Floated the idea of a simple website for the workflow, possibly built on Google Drive.
- **Feb 19** — Felt the editing pace isn't enough. Considering Upwork for additional Malayalam+English editors. Need to figure out per-video pricing — could ask current editor or consult an outside freelancer.

## Last seen breadcrumbs
- Checking Upwork for Malayalam+English video editors is the most concrete next move
- Asking the current editor about fair per-video rates could shortcut the pricing question
- A lightweight web tool for editor coordination could emerge — possibly from whatever gets built for Project Zero
- The video pipeline, once simplified, could be reused for Mridhu product videos and other channels
