# SVK YouTube

## Story so far
SVK English Classes is a YouTube channel run by the author's father. There's already a working process: recorded videos go to an editor via Google Drive, the editor sends back the finished video and thumbnail. It works well enough, but there's friction. The desire is to simplify the handoff, bring on more editors so more videos can be produced, and drive down the per-video editing cost.

There's also an idea floating around to build a simple website for the workflow — something that could sit on top of Google Drive itself and make the whole coordination lighter. Nothing has been built yet, but the need is felt.

## Timeline
- **Feb 10** — Described the current Google Drive-based video editing workflow. Noted the desire to onboard more editors, simplify the process, and reduce costs. Floated the idea of a simple website for the workflow, possibly built on Google Drive.

## Last seen breadcrumbs
- Running a few more video cycles through the current workflow to see where the actual friction is
- A lightweight web tool for editor coordination could emerge — possibly from whatever gets built for Project Zero
- The video pipeline, once simplified, could be reused for other channels
