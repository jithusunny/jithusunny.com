# SVK YouTube Summary

## Context
SVK English Classes is a YouTube channel run by the author's father, with a Google Drive-based video editing workflow involving an external editor.

## Highlights
- Current workflow: share recorded videos and details with editor via Google Drive; editor returns edited video and thumbnail
- Want to simplify the process, onboard more editors, and reduce per-video editing costs
- Idea to create a simple website for the video editing workflow, possibly built on top of Google Drive

## Next (could)
Try the current workflow for a few more video cycles to identify friction points, then explore a lightweight web tool to streamline editor onboarding.
