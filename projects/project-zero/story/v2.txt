"We do not author our thoughts. They appear, unbidden, from the void — and most of us live our entire lives without once turning around to look."

Jithu felt overwhelmed. Ideas flooding in daily, loops replaying, plans shifting, nothing closing. After years of meditation, spiritual inquiry, and a career writing software for others, he realized: the thoughts running through his mind are the foundation of everything — every project, every decision, every relationship, every day. If he could see them clearly, he could live clearly. So he started writing them down — raw, messy, unfiltered — into plain text files on a website. That was the beginning of Project Zero.

This software — the Thought Tracker — is the first tool born from that practice. It is deliberately small. It does one thing: lets you capture and revisit your thoughts with zero friction.

Here's how you use it. You're at your laptop. A thought surfaces — something about a project, a feeling, a decision, an observation. You open the app. You see a list of your most recent thoughts — ten at a time, with the newest first. Each one shows when it was captured and how it begins. You can page through older thoughts using Next and Previous buttons at the bottom. You click "Add Thought." A blank page opens. You type. You hit Save. The thought is stored instantly and you're back at the list. If you accidentally hit the back button or try to close the tab while typing, the browser warns you — but saving is seamless, no warnings, no friction.

You click on any thought to read it in full — plain text, nothing fancy. A Home button takes you back.

No accounts, no databases, no cloud sync, no mobile app. Just a local web app, plain text files, and your thoughts. Everything else will come in later versions.
