"We do not author our thoughts. They appear, unbidden, from the void — and most of us live our entire lives without once turning around to look."

Jithu felt overwhelmed. Ideas flooding in daily, loops replaying, plans shifting, nothing closing. After years of meditation, spiritual inquiry, and a career writing software for others, he realized: the thoughts running through his mind are the foundation of everything — every project, every decision, every relationship, every day. If he could see them clearly, he could live clearly. So he started writing them down — raw, messy, unfiltered — into plain text files on a website. That was the beginning of Project Zero.

This software — the Thought Tracker — is the first tool born from that practice. It is deliberately small. It does one thing: lets you capture and revisit your thoughts with zero friction.

Here's how you use it. You're at your laptop. A thought surfaces — something about a project, a feeling, a decision, an observation. You open the app. You see a list of your previous thoughts — each one showing when it was captured and how it begins. You click "Add Thought." A blank page opens. You type. You save. That's it. The thought is now outside your head, in a place where you can find it again. You go back to the list. Your latest thought is at the top. Later, you click on it and read it again — maybe something new surfaces from it.

No accounts, no databases, no cloud sync, no mobile app. Just a local web app, plain text files, and your thoughts. Everything else will come in later versions.
