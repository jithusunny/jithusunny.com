Build the Thought Tracker from the current spec and task list.

Read these files:
- projects/project-zero/spec/current.txt (the full spec)
- projects/project-zero/tasks/current.txt (the task list — work through these in order)
- projects/project-zero/story/current.txt (context on what this is)
- projects/project-zero/blueprint/current.yaml (component map)
- building_blocks/ (reusable code blocks — use as directed by the tasks)

Rules:
1. Delete the existing projects/project-zero/app/ folder and create it fresh.

2. IMPORTANT STRUCTURE RULE:
   - Organize the generated app by components from the blueprint.
   - All generated code must live under:
     projects/project-zero/app/components/<component_name>/
   - projects/project-zero/app/main.py must be a thin wiring file only (FastAPI app setup + route inclusion + template/static setup). No business logic in main.py.
   - Keep templates and static assets inside their owning UI component folder under:
     projects/project-zero/app/components/<ui_component>/templates/
     projects/project-zero/app/components/<ui_component>/static/

3. Work through the tasks in order. For each task:
   - Build what it describes, following the spec exactly.
   - If tasks mention files at app root (e.g., storage.py, templates/, static/), adapt the file locations to the component structure above, without changing behavior.
   - Update the task status to "done" in the tasks file.
   - If anything notable happened — a choice not obvious from the code, a tradeoff, a reason for how you organized things — add a short "Notes:" section under that task. Keep notes about the generation/organization process, not code logic (the code should speak for itself). Don't force notes if there's nothing worth noting.

4. Copy and use building blocks as specified in the tasks. Do not modify building blocks in place — if a block needs project-specific changes, copy it into the app and adapt there.

5. Use virtualenv for Python dependencies.

6. After all tasks are done:
   - Verify the app runs (start server, test key pages, confirm no errors).
   - Kill the test server and free the port.
   - Confirm the README has clear setup and run instructions.
   - Briefly tell the user how to start the app.
