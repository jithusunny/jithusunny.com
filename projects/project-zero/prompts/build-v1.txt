Build the Thought Tracker v1.

Read these files first:
- projects/project-zero/spec/current.txt (the full spec)
- projects/project-zero/tasks/current.txt (the task list)
- projects/project-zero/story/current.txt (context on what this is)

Then work through the tasks in order. For each task:
1. Build what it describes, following the spec exactly
2. Update the task status to "done" in projects/project-zero/tasks/current.txt
3. If anything notable happened during the task — a choice you made that isn't obvious from the code, a tradeoff, something you tried and changed, a reason for how you organized things — add a short "Notes:" section under that task. Keep notes about the generation/organization process, not about code logic (the code should speak for itself). Don't force notes if there's nothing worth noting.

All app code goes in projects/project-zero/app/

Use Python, FastAPI, plain HTML/CSS/JS, .md file storage. No database, no frameworks, no external services.

Thoughts are stored at: raw/{YYYY}/{MM}/{DD}/{HHMM}.txt (relative to the repo root, which is one level above the app directory).

After all tasks are done, confirm the app runs and briefly tell me how to start it.
