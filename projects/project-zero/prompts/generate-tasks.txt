Generate the task list for building the Thought Tracker from the current spec.

Read these files:
- projects/project-zero/spec/current.txt
- projects/project-zero/story/current.txt
- projects/project-zero/blueprint/current.yaml
- projects/project-zero/tasks/v*.txt (previous task lists — for patterns and lessons only)
- projects/project-zero/spec/v*.txt (previous specs — for context only)
- building_blocks/ (existing reusable building blocks)

Your job:

1. Read the current spec completely.

2. Read the blueprint and understand the components of the system.
   - Components define the major parts of the software.
   - Tasks MUST be organized by component.
   - Do NOT invent new components in tasks.

3. For each component in the blueprint:
   - Identify what must be built to satisfy the spec.
   - Check the building_blocks/ library:
     - If a block already covers the need, reference it in the task.
     - If a new reusable block is clearly justified, plan it explicitly as a task.
     - Otherwise, keep the logic project-specific.

4. Review previous task lists for:
   - Ordering patterns that worked well
   - Known pitfalls or cleanup steps
   - Notes worth preserving

5. Produce a complete task list that builds the ENTIRE application from scratch.
   - Tasks are not incremental patches.
   - The first task must delete the existing app/ directory and start fresh.
   - Tasks must be specific and actionable.
   - Each task MUST clearly state which component it belongs to.

STRUCTURE OF TASKS (REQUIRED):

- Group tasks under clear component headings.
- Each task should begin with the component name, e.g.:
  [storage_fs] Implement filesystem persistence
  [ui_thought_list] Render paginated list of thoughts

Before writing:
- Rename the existing tasks/current.txt to the next version number.
- Write the new task list as tasks/current.txt.

Output:
- projects/project-zero/tasks/current.txt (new)
- Any new or updated building blocks in building_blocks/
