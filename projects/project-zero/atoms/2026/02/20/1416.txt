Thought:
Projects need to store not just thoughts but events with operational details — e.g., "Created OAuth client in GCP" with credentials, config values, maintenance needs, cleanup procedures. Also need a place for config/secrets/variables. Without capturing these from the start, the project can't be fully reproduced from its source material.
