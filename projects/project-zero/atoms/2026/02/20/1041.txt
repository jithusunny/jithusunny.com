The new software process: capture thoughts about the problem/solution → translate to specs (software, UI/UX, tests, user guide, creation story/video) → generate code + tests → run tests → deploy → production checks. Feedback loops at each level escalate questions back to the human. A simple UI for supervising the multi-step process.
