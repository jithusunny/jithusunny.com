Thought:
Don't-touch-code approach: thoughts become specs, specs regenerate all levels — code, docs, architecture diagrams, project demos, videos. Manual code editing creates tech debt. Modularity and reuse across projects (like polylith architecture). Regenerate doesn't mean LLM generates entire codebase fresh each time — modular, plug-and-play design makes it efficient.
