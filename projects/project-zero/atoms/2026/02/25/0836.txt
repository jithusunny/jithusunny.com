Thought:
"The thing I'm trying to create already exists. It is like a spot in the forest. I just need to find my way to that. And how do I find my way? By being systematic about this process — these decisions, constraints, what-ifs — I need to write those down and figure out the next step. Simply by walking and talking, the path is not revealing itself."
