Thought:
The pipeline for building software from thoughts: raw thoughts → story (the why, causal connections between events) + spec (the what, full details) + documentation (how to use) → tests → code → deploy. If anything is unclear at any step, questions go back to the previous level for the human to answer. Those answers become input to the next iteration.
