Thought:
Don't try to fix or straighten thought patterns — that attitude of being the one who puts everything in its place produces resistance from those self-reinforcing patterns. Just observe. Thought is not the reason you do things — it's a signal, maybe 1% causal. It indicates what is about to happen through you.
