Thought:
Each iteration must regenerate the entire software fresh from the spec. No editing on top of editing. One-to-one mapping from thoughts to spec to software with no drift. Reusable building blocks (polyglot/polylith architecture) don't get rebuilt — only the arrangement changes. But overall it should be as if built from scratch each iteration.
