Thought:
Self-observation can backfire. The ego trying to find itself creates loops — like Alan Watts' thief going upstairs when the police arrive. The part that declares victory after spotting a pattern is where the ego has moved to now. It can be rough and disappointing. Malayalam proverb: even ambrosia in excess is poison. Moderation needed. This is not for everyone.
