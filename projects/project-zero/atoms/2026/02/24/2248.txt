Thought:
Shut down the day properly — clean up the room, put everything in its place, capture finances, no lingering files in systems. Start up the next day with fresh air, body movement, meditation. As each day passes, make the shutdown more complete. When you are ready to die fully, you are ready to live fully. Nothing sticky from yesterday — open and fresh to the moment.
