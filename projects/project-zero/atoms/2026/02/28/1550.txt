Thought:
Building blocks: reusable code organized by language (python/, html/, js/, css/) inside a building_blocks/ folder at repo root. Each block gets its own folder with a readme.md (precise definition, usage, examples) and code files. No project-specific stuff. Must be standalone where possible. Planner checks existing blocks for reuse and identifies new ones to create.
