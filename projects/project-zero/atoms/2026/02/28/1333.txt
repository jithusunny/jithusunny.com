Thought:
App code goes in projects/project-zero/app/. Task tracker goes in projects/project-zero/tasks/current.txt. When Cursor builds the software, it should update task statuses and add process notes under each task — not about code logic, but about why/how the code was generated and organized. This helps future iterations understand the generation process.
