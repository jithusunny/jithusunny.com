Thought:
Need three reusable prompts that work across iterations: (1) generate spec from thoughts — paying more attention to latest thoughts when things are superseded or contradicted, focusing only on the subset concretely defined for the next version; (2) generate task tracker from spec — designing execution using existing building blocks and planning new ones; (3) implement code from tasks — delete app, recreate fresh using building blocks.
