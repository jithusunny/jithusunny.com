# Project Zero Summary

## Context
Project Zero is a system and way of life for living with clarity and direction. It starts as a personal thought-tracking system on jithusunny.com — capturing raw thoughts in plain text files — and aims to grow into an interconnected system that handles thoughts, events, projects, and eventually automates actions. It aims to self-destruct once no longer needed.

## Highlights
- Set up a Cursor rule to automate extraction of atomic thoughts and events from raw thoughts — first full batch processed
- Transcribed morning walk audio and added to raw thoughts
- Tension growing: fear that this is all thinking without visible output — need to produce proof, "show, don't tell"
- Each project needs a common view: what happened, what is happening, what could happen — this workflow applies across all projects
- Named the project "Project Zero" — transcript-friendly, carries productive charge
- Raw thoughts captured as immutable plain text (raw/YYYY/MM/DD/HHMM.txt), decoupled from system, exportable
- AI/LLM extracts atomic thoughts from raw dumps — clerical work automated
- Extraction workflow: one thought per file, tagged by type (rule, decision, intent, insight, tension, pull, todo, spec, risk)
- Audio thought pipeline set up: Easy Recorder → Google Drive autosave → AssemblyAI transcription
- Make.com chosen for workflow automation (escalate to n8n then custom)
- Long todo lists recognized as demotivating — prefer story-like summaries with game-like breadcrumbs
- Projects support identified as the most important next step

## Next (could)
Build the common "what happened / happening / could happen" project view, automate the record→transcribe→notify pipeline using Make.com, or produce a first visible artifact (blog post or Shopify site for Mridhu).
