Thought Tracker — Version 1 Specification

Overview
A local web application for capturing and reading thoughts. Thoughts are stored as plain text .md files. No database. No authentication. No deployment. Runs on a laptop.

Technology
- Backend: Python, FastAPI
- Frontend: Plain HTML, CSS, JavaScript (no frameworks)
- Storage: .md files on disk
- No database, no external services

File Storage
- Thoughts are saved as .md files
- Path structure: raw/{YYYY}/{MM}/{DD}/{HHMM}.txt
- Filename is derived from the timestamp when the thought is saved
- If a file with that timestamp already exists, increment the minute (HHMM → HH(MM+1))
- Create directories automatically if they don't exist

Pages

1. Home Page (/)
- Lists all thoughts, newest first
- Each item shows:
  - Date and time (human-readable, e.g. "Feb 28, 2026 · 12:43 PM")
  - Preview: first ~120 characters of the thought text, followed by ellipsis if truncated
- Each item is a clickable link to the read page for that thought
- "Add Thought" button fixed at the top right corner
- Must load fast — no unnecessary assets, no heavy CSS frameworks

2. Add Thought Page (/add)
- Large white text area filling most of the screen
- Plain text input (no rich text, no markdown preview)
- "Save" button clearly visible
- Protect against accidental loss:
  - Warn on browser back button if text area has content
  - Warn on page close/refresh if text area has content (beforeunload)
- On save:
  - Write content to .md file at the timestamp-based path
  - Redirect to home page

3. Read Thought Page (/thought/{path})
- Displays the full text of the thought in a simple, readable layout
- Plain text, preserving line breaks
- "Home" button/link to go back to the list
- No editing capability in v1

Design Principles
- Lightning fast — minimal CSS, no JavaScript frameworks, no unnecessary assets
- Clean, readable typography — generous line height, comfortable width
- White background, dark text, minimal UI chrome
- Works in any modern browser

Code Principles
- Minimal, readable, maintainable
- Group into reusable modules where natural (e.g., file I/O, path generation, thought listing)
- Clear separation: routes, templates, storage logic
- Include a README with:
  - Any setup needed (e.g., pip install)
  - How to run the app
  - Where thoughts are stored

What Is NOT In V1
- No deployment instructions or configuration
- No mobile-specific design
- No audio recording or transcription
- No authentication or multi-user support
- No search or filtering
- No editing or deleting thoughts
- No database
- No processing/extraction of atomic thoughts
