Thought:
Versioned YouTube videos: V1 is raw and imperfect, V2 has better editing, one more point, more energy, fewer uhms. This removes the pressure of perfection. Over time, get good at one-shotting videos — little to no planning, little to no editing, decent lighting. Already have a good mic and camera.
