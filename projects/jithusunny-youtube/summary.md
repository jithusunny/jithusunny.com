## Story so far
This channel doesn't exist yet. It lives as a pull — a recurring attraction toward capturing daily life on video. The idea is to treat every day as a rebirth and record the main things about it. Not polished content, not tutorials — just the unfolding of a life, captured in small pieces. Over time, these clips would shape into something like a movie. Maybe eventually a book.

The pull is real but hasn't been acted on. It sits alongside the morning walk audio recordings, which are already a kind of prototype — raw, unedited, honest captures of what's happening in the mind on a given day. The difference is that this channel would add the visual layer.

A more specific vision has started forming: videos built like a building — atomic note videos that form interdependent sets, each explaining some topic, project, or concept. The idea is that eventually, videos on certain topics could be auto-generated from atomic notes. The note equivalents should probably come first, but that shouldn't be a complete blocker — small experimental videos could start anytime.

A concrete angle emerged: start by showing how software is built. Live, transparent development — people can see the process, the decisions, the real-time state of what's being created. This connects naturally to the portfolio idea and the don't-touch-code approach. But open questions remain about language (Malayalam or English?) and channel structure (one channel or multiple?).

## Timeline
- **Feb 10** — The idea surfaced during a long morning writing session. Daily capture video, every day treated as a rebirth. Momentum in this pattern matters more than any single video. Alongside it, a pull toward writing a book about life's unfolding, using everyday happenings as raw material.
- **Feb 19 (early)** — A more concrete vision emerged: atomic note videos that form interdependent sets — like building bricks for any topic. Auto-generation from notes as a future possibility. Do notes first, but don't be fully blocked — try small videos.
- **Feb 19 (night)** — A specific starting angle: create videos showing how software is built, live and transparent. Unsure about Malayalam vs English and one channel vs multiple.

## Last seen breadcrumbs
- The software development angle is the most concrete starting point — pick a small project and record the process
- The language and channel structure questions (Malayalam/English, one/multiple) need a decision, or just a first experiment
- The morning walk audio recordings are already half of this — adding video is the natural extension
- The atomic note video concept could start with one small topic already well-understood
