# Jithusunny YouTube

## Story so far
This channel started as a pull — a recurring attraction toward capturing daily life on video. The idea was to treat every day as a rebirth and record the main things about it. Not polished content, not tutorials — just the unfolding of a life, captured in small pieces. Over time, these clips would shape into something like a movie. Maybe eventually a book.

A more specific vision formed along the way: videos built like a building — atomic note videos that form interdependent sets, each explaining some topic, project, or concept. The idea is that eventually, videos on certain topics could be auto-generated from atomic notes. The note equivalents should probably come first, but that shouldn't be a complete blocker — small experimental videos could start anytime.

A concrete angle emerged: start by showing how software is built. Live, transparent development — people can see the process, the decisions, the real-time state of what's being created. Open questions lingered about language (Malayalam or English?) and channel structure (one channel or multiple?).

Then, on Feb 24, the first video was actually uploaded: "12 benefits of putting everything in its own place." It happened. The pull finally turned into action.

And alongside it, a new approach crystallized: versioned videos. V1 is raw and imperfect — just talk about your thoughts on something. V2 is the same video, better — more editing, one more point, more energy, fewer uhms. The pressure of perfection is off. Over time, the goal is to get good at one-shotting videos: little to no planning, little to no editing, decent lighting. The mic and camera are already good. Content can come easily once the habit forms.

A small insight also surfaced: a 13th point for the "everything in its own place" video — you start to like yourself more. When you find things quickly and easily, you feel cared for by your past self. That gratitude feeds forward.

## Timeline
- **Feb 10** — The idea surfaced during a long morning writing session. Daily capture video, every day treated as a rebirth. Momentum in this pattern matters more than any single video. Alongside it, a pull toward writing a book about life's unfolding, using everyday happenings as raw material.
- **Feb 19 (early)** — A more concrete vision emerged: atomic note videos that form interdependent sets — like building bricks for any topic. Auto-generation from notes as a future possibility. Do notes first, but don't be fully blocked — try small videos.
- **Feb 19 (night)** — A specific starting angle: create videos showing how software is built, live and transparent. Unsure about Malayalam vs English and one channel vs multiple.
- **Feb 24** — First video uploaded: "12 benefits of putting everything in its own place." The versioned videos approach crystallized: V1 raw, V2 polished, reducing perfection pressure. Goal: one-shot videos with minimal planning. Discovered a 13th point for the video — organization makes you like yourself more.

## Last seen breadcrumbs
- The first video is out — the next one could be V2 of the same topic or a new topic entirely
- The versioned approach means any video can be recorded now without pressure — just call it V1
- The software development angle is still a strong starting point — record building the thoughts app v1
- The language and channel structure questions remain open but are less blocking now that the first video happened
