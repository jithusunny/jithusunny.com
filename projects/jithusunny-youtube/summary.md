## Story so far
This channel started as a pull — a recurring attraction toward capturing daily life on video. The idea was to treat every day as a rebirth and record the main things about it. Not polished content, not tutorials — just the unfolding of a life, captured in small pieces.

A more specific vision formed along the way: videos built like a building — atomic note videos that form interdependent sets, each explaining some topic, project, or concept. Eventually, videos on certain topics could be auto-generated from atomic notes.

A concrete angle emerged: start by showing how software is built. Live, transparent development. Open questions lingered about language and channel structure.

Then, on Feb 24, the first video was actually uploaded: "12 benefits of putting everything in its own place." The pull turned into action. A versioned approach crystallized: V1 is raw and imperfect, V2 is the same video but better. The pressure of perfection is off. Over time, the goal is one-shot videos: little planning, little editing, decent lighting. The mic and camera are already good.

By Feb 26, the channel's role became clearer through a new connection: YouTube livestreams as the medium for the thought-to-software process. Build the thought tracker live and publicly — describe the software in a livestream, transcribe, generate spec and code, then inspect and give feedback in the next livestream. It creates accountability, feedback, motivation, and content all at once. "This whole universe is about showing us, like Alan Watts says, this is a show. So this is maybe my show."

A livestream was actually attempted — to establish the process — but was deleted due to perfectionism and self-judgment. The pattern is familiar. But the intent is alive and the process is now designed concretely.

## Timeline
- **Feb 10** — The idea surfaced. Daily capture video, every day treated as a rebirth. Pull toward writing a book using everyday happenings as raw material.
- **Feb 19 (early)** — Atomic note videos concept. Auto-generation from notes as future possibility.
- **Feb 19 (night)** — Specific angle: videos showing how software is built, live and transparent.
- **Feb 24** — First video uploaded: "12 benefits of putting everything in its own place." Versioned videos approach (V1 raw, V2 polished). 13th point discovered.
- **Feb 26** — YouTube livestreams designed as the medium for the thought-to-software process: describe → build → inspect → feedback → repeat. A livestream was attempted and deleted. The plan is concrete, ready for another attempt.

## Last seen breadcrumbs
- The livestream process for building the thought tracker is designed and ready for attempt #2
- The deleted livestream is a familiar pattern — next time, just leave it up, imperfect or not
- The first video is out and the versioned approach removes pressure — any recording can be V1
- Building the thought tracker live could be the channel's defining content series
