## Story so far
This channel doesn't exist yet. It lives as a pull — a recurring attraction toward capturing daily life on video. The idea is to treat every day as a rebirth and record the main things about it. Not polished content, not tutorials — just the unfolding of a life, captured in small pieces. Over time, these clips would shape into something like a movie. Maybe eventually a book.

The pull is real but hasn't been acted on. It sits alongside the morning walk audio recordings, which are already a kind of prototype — raw, unedited, honest captures of what's happening in the mind on a given day. The difference is that this channel would add the visual layer.

## Timeline
- **Feb 10** — The idea surfaced during a long morning writing session. Daily capture video, every day treated as a rebirth. Momentum in this pattern matters more than any single video. Alongside it, a pull toward writing a book about life's unfolding, using everyday happenings as raw material.

## Last seen breadcrumbs
- Recording one short clip of a single day to see how it feels
- The morning walk audio recordings are already half of this — adding video is the natural extension
- What "daily capture" actually looks like in practice (length, format, tone) is undefined and could be discovered by just trying
