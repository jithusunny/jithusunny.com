# First Sale — Minimal Plan

Purpose: make one real sale, not build a store.

## 1. Choose one product
- One queen-size bedsheet
- One material, one design
- Treat this as an experiment

## 2. Prepare it
- Light iron, neat fold
- Decide price and actual stock count

## 3. Shoot content
- Natural daylight only
- Capture:
  - Full bed view
  - Folded view
  - Texture close-up
  - Stitching detail
  - One short video

## 4. Create product page
- One product in Shopify
- Simple title + 4–5 bullets
- Upload best photos
- Enter real price and stock

## 5. Sell via DMs
- Instagram DM flow
- Shopify = credibility only

## 6. Post once
- One post or reel
- Simple caption
- “DM to order”
- Pin it

## 7. Fulfil
- Fast replies
- UPI payment
- Manual shipping
- Share tracking

## 8. Close loop
- Ask if they liked it
- Collect feedback if offered
