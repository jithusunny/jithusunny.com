# Mridhu Summary

## Context
Mridhu is an online boutique business (mridhu.in) being set up by the author's wife Elsa, selling bed sheets, dresses, and similar products. Domain bought, launching-soon page live, Instagram linked. Focus has shifted to getting a Shopify storefront up, product content ready, and shipping logistics in place.

## Highlights
- Decision made: create a Shopify site for mridhu.in instead of building custom e-commerce — move faster, hide post-date visibility problem that Instagram has
- Four main work areas identified: (1) Shopify site/platform, (2) product photos and videos, (3) packaging/logistics supplies, (4) accounts/registration/digital presence
- Product photos and videos are the hardest part — requires confidence, attractive presentation, reference templates for angles and scripts
- Plan to shoot an unboxing-style video — pack as if shipping, then open on camera to showcase product
- Equipment ready: iPhone 17 Pro Max for photos, Insta360 Flow 2 Pro gimbal for stable video
- Website can wait behind Shopify — product content and shipping readiness are higher priority
- Need: WhatsApp Business account, Instagram profile pic from logo, first brand post
- Need: label printer, packaging covers, and to check DTDC courier rates for Kerala
- Elsa's energy and happiness directly tied to Mridhu progress — supporting this supports the whole family system

## Next (could)
Create the Shopify site today, shoot first product photos/videos using iPhone + gimbal, or assess the delivery/fulfillment process to identify what supplies to order.
