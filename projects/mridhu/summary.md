# Mridhu

## Story so far
Mridhu is Elsa's online boutique — bed sheets, dresses, things sourced from different places and sold through mridhu.in. The domain was bought, a launching-soon page went up, Instagram got linked. But the real work hadn't started.

Early on, the priorities were clear: product content first, website later. Photos and videos of what's being sold matter more than a fancy storefront. Practical todos accumulated — WhatsApp business account, Instagram branding, a label printer, courier rate checks.

Then during a morning walk on Feb 17, the thinking deepened. Posting products on Instagram has a subtle problem: everyone can see when something was posted. If it's still unsold after 30 days, it looks stale. A proper storefront hides that. So the decision was made: Shopify, not a custom build. No more waiting to build something from scratch — Shopify handles the platform, and the business can move faster.

Four work areas crystallized: the Shopify platform, product photos and videos (the hardest part — requires showing your personality and being judged), packaging and logistics supplies, and accounts and digital presence. An unboxing video idea emerged too — pack everything as if shipping to a customer, then open it on camera.

Execution started the same day. An email and Shopify plan was sketched with ChatGPT. The original plan was elegant: mridhubyelsa@gmail.com for admin, care@mridhu.in for customers. But GoDaddy email forwarding was a pain. Google Business Suite felt like overkill. Zoho was convoluted. All of it was dropped. Just Gmail for everything, for now.

Shopify got signed up, the theme updated, the domain connected via GoDaddy integration. Then the payments problem: Stripe doesn't support India. Pivoted to Razorpay, completed the video KYC. Now waiting for their approval.

There's an undercurrent running through all of this: Elsa's happiness and energy are directly tied to Mridhu's progress, and that affects everything else in the household. Supporting Mridhu isn't just about a business — it's about keeping the whole system running.

## Timeline
- **Feb 10** — First mention of Mridhu in the thought stream. Set priorities: product images and videos first, website can wait. Shipping supplies needed.
- **Feb 11** — Listed concrete todos: WhatsApp business account, Instagram profile pic from logo, first brand post, label printer, check DTDC courier rates for Kerala.
- **Feb 17 morning** — During a walk, decided to go with Shopify over custom e-commerce. Identified four work areas. Noticed Instagram's date-visibility problem for unsold items. Came up with the unboxing video concept. Recognized that photo/video shooting is the hardest part.
- **Feb 17 early afternoon** — Created mridhubyelsa@gmail.com. Planned domain email forwarding via GoDaddy but abandoned it — too much friction. Tried Zoho and Google Workspace paths, abandoned those too. Decided: Gmail for everything for now.
- **Feb 17 afternoon** — Signed up for Shopify with the new Gmail. Updated store theme. Connected mridhu.in domain. Discovered Stripe doesn't work in India — pivoted to Razorpay.
- **Feb 17 evening** — Completed Razorpay video KYC. Pending approval from their end.

## Last seen breadcrumbs
- Razorpay approval should come through — then test a real payment with UPI
- The store is empty — shooting first product photos and videos with the iPhone and Insta360 gimbal is the natural next move
- The unboxing video idea is ready to try with whatever products are on hand
- Packaging supplies and label printer still need ordering
