# Mridhu

## Story so far
Mridhu is Elsa's online boutique — bed sheets, dresses, things sourced from different places and sold through mridhu.in. The domain was bought, a launching-soon page went up, Instagram got linked. But the real work hadn't started.

Early on, the priorities were clear: product content first, website later. Photos and videos of what's being sold matter more than a fancy storefront. Practical todos accumulated — WhatsApp business account, Instagram branding, a label printer, courier rate checks.

Then during a morning walk on Feb 17, the thinking deepened. Posting products on Instagram has a subtle problem: everyone can see when something was posted. If it's still unsold after 30 days, it looks stale. A proper storefront hides that. So the decision was made: Shopify, not a custom build. No more waiting to build something from scratch — Shopify handles the platform, and the business can move faster.

Four work areas crystallized: the Shopify platform, product photos and videos (the hardest part — requires showing your personality and being judged), packaging and logistics supplies, and accounts and digital presence. An unboxing video idea emerged too — pack everything as if shipping to a customer, then open it on camera.

Execution started the same day. An email and Shopify plan was sketched with ChatGPT. The original plan was elegant: mridhubyelsa@gmail.com for admin, care@mridhu.in for customers. But GoDaddy email forwarding was a pain. Google Business Suite felt like overkill. Zoho was convoluted. All of it was dropped. Just Gmail for everything, for now.

Shopify got signed up, the theme updated, the domain connected via GoDaddy integration. Then the payments problem: Stripe doesn't support India. Pivoted to Razorpay, completed the video KYC.

By Feb 18, things moved from planning into real setup. Razorpay registration finished — Standard plan, free and postpaid, no fee till Rs.5000. The Razorpay Shopify plugin was installed, though website review needs to clear before payment setup is complete. GST registration was skipped — not needed up to Rs.40 lakh.

That same day, Elsa and Jithu shot the first product photos — two bedsheets on the dining table at night, using the halo lamp. The pictures came out okay. A ChatGPT-generated plan for a better photoshoot with natural light was saved for next time.

The Shopify store was configured end to end: general details filled in, Heritage theme selected, logo generated with ChatGPT and uploaded (primary color #C8A24D, secondary #1F1F1F), order settings tuned (manual fulfillment, auto-archive), policies set, shipping limited to Kerala at Rs.80, tax at 0%. The first product went up — Green cross stitched Bedsheet Queen size. The site is minimal, just one product, but it looks good.

## Timeline
- **Feb 10** — First mention of Mridhu in the thought stream. Set priorities: product images and videos first, website can wait. Shipping supplies needed.
- **Feb 11** — Listed concrete todos: WhatsApp business account, Instagram profile pic from logo, first brand post, label printer, check DTDC courier rates for Kerala.
- **Feb 17 morning** — During a walk, decided to go with Shopify over custom e-commerce. Identified four work areas. Noticed Instagram's date-visibility problem for unsold items. Came up with the unboxing video concept. Recognized that photo/video shooting is the hardest part.
- **Feb 17 early afternoon** — Created mridhubyelsa@gmail.com. Planned domain email forwarding via GoDaddy but abandoned it — too much friction. Tried Zoho and Google Workspace paths, abandoned those too. Decided: Gmail for everything for now.
- **Feb 17 afternoon** — Signed up for Shopify with the new Gmail. Updated store theme. Connected mridhu.in domain. Discovered Stripe doesn't work in India — pivoted to Razorpay.
- **Feb 17 evening** — Completed Razorpay video KYC. Pending approval from their end.
- **Feb 18** — Completed Razorpay registration (Standard plan). Installed Razorpay Shopify plugin. Shot first product photos of two bedsheets with Elsa at night. Generated logo with ChatGPT and uploaded it. Configured entire Shopify store — theme, policies, shipping, tax. Added first product (Green cross stitched Bedsheet Queen size). Site is live and looks good.

## Last seen breadcrumbs
- Razorpay website review needs to clear before payment setup is fully functional — then test a real UPI payment
- The first product is up but natural-light photos could make it shine — a photoshoot plan is ready
- The unboxing video idea is waiting to be tried with whatever products are on hand
- Packaging supplies and label printer still need ordering
- Shopify plan may need revisiting in May (brick-and-mortar vs. social starter)
