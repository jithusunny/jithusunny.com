# Mridhu

## Story so far
Mridhu is Elsa's online boutique — bed sheets, dresses, things sourced from different places and sold through mridhu.in. The domain was bought, a launching-soon page went up, Instagram got linked. But the real work hadn't started.

Early on, the priorities were clear: product content first, website later. Photos and videos of what's being sold matter more than a fancy storefront. Practical todos accumulated — WhatsApp business account, Instagram branding, a label printer, courier rate checks.

Then during a morning walk on Feb 17, the thinking deepened. Posting products on Instagram has a subtle problem: everyone can see when something was posted. If it's still unsold after 30 days, it looks stale. A proper storefront hides that. So the decision was made: Shopify, not a custom build. No more waiting to build something from scratch — Shopify handles the platform, and the business can move faster.

Four work areas crystallized: the Shopify platform, product photos and videos (the hardest part — requires showing your personality and being judged), packaging and logistics supplies, and accounts and digital presence. An unboxing video idea emerged too — pack everything as if shipping to a customer, then open it on camera.

Execution started the same day. An email and Shopify plan was sketched with ChatGPT. The original plan was elegant: mridhubyelsa@gmail.com for admin, care@mridhu.in for customers. But GoDaddy email forwarding was a pain. Google Business Suite felt like overkill. Zoho was convoluted. All of it was dropped. Just Gmail for everything, for now.

Shopify got signed up, the theme updated, the domain connected via GoDaddy integration. Then the payments problem: Stripe doesn't support India. Pivoted to Razorpay, completed the video KYC.

By Feb 18, things moved from planning into real setup. Razorpay registration finished — Standard plan, free and postpaid, no fee till Rs.5000. The Razorpay Shopify plugin was installed. GST registration was skipped — not needed up to Rs.40 lakh.

That same day, Elsa and Jithu shot the first product photos — two bedsheets on the dining table at night, using the halo lamp. The pictures came out okay. A ChatGPT-generated plan for a better photoshoot with natural light was saved for next time.

The Shopify store was configured end to end: general details filled in, Heritage theme selected, logo generated with ChatGPT and uploaded (primary color #C8A24D, secondary #1F1F1F), order settings tuned (manual fulfillment, auto-archive), policies set, shipping limited to Kerala at Rs.80, tax at 0%. The first product went up — Green cross stitched Bedsheet Queen size. The site is minimal, just one product, but it looks good.

By Feb 19, the next bottleneck became clear: product videos. Video editing is needed for Mridhu product content, and it's the main thing blocking forward motion. Proper product photos and videos still need to be shot the right way, and a WhatsApp Business number needs setting up.

On Feb 23, things moved forward significantly. Photos and videos of two more bedsheets were added to the Shopify store — but not without friction. HEIC and MOV files from the iPhone needed converting, and that turned into an 80-minute detour through online converters and command-line tools. The commands were documented for next time. Product details for the new bedsheet were generated using ChatGPT in 20 minutes — using the first product's content and the new product image as input, a workflow that's starting to feel repeatable.

Then the payments story completed. Earlier in the day, Razorpay was set up but only supporting cards. By the afternoon, UPI, netbanking, and wallets were all enabled. The full order flow was tested — checkout, order, refund — everything works. The store can now take real money through any payment method Indians actually use. One friction remains: card is the default on the checkout page, and UPI requires clicking away to a hosted Razorpay page. A support ticket has been raised about showing UPI directly on the checkout page.

The theme was updated to "whisper" and needs further configuration. Packaging needs reassessment — the brown bags bought earlier were too small and were returned. A label printer is on the list, with the added insight that it could serve triple duty: Mridhu product labels, home organization stickers, and quick printed notes. Shipping rates need checking with the nearby DTDC office, and product pricing and shipping charges still need deciding.

## Timeline
- **Feb 10** — First mention of Mridhu in the thought stream. Set priorities: product images and videos first, website can wait. Shipping supplies needed.
- **Feb 11** — Listed concrete todos: WhatsApp business account, Instagram profile pic from logo, first brand post, label printer, check DTDC courier rates for Kerala.
- **Feb 17 morning** — During a walk, decided to go with Shopify over custom e-commerce. Identified four work areas. Noticed Instagram's date-visibility problem for unsold items. Came up with the unboxing video concept. Recognized that photo/video shooting is the hardest part.
- **Feb 17 early afternoon** — Created mridhubyelsa@gmail.com. Planned domain email forwarding via GoDaddy but abandoned it — too much friction. Tried Zoho and Google Workspace paths, abandoned those too. Decided: Gmail for everything for now.
- **Feb 17 afternoon** — Signed up for Shopify with the new Gmail. Updated store theme. Connected mridhu.in domain. Discovered Stripe doesn't work in India — pivoted to Razorpay.
- **Feb 17 evening** — Completed Razorpay video KYC. Pending approval from their end.
- **Feb 18** — Completed Razorpay registration (Standard plan). Installed Razorpay Shopify plugin. Shot first product photos of two bedsheets with Elsa at night. Generated logo with ChatGPT and uploaded it. Configured entire Shopify store — theme, policies, shipping, tax. Added first product (Green cross stitched Bedsheet Queen size). Site is live and looks good.
- **Feb 19** — Identified video editing as the next main blocker. Need to shoot proper product photos/videos and get WABA number set up.
- **Feb 23 (morning)** — Added photos and videos of 2 more bedsheets to the store. Spent 80 minutes figuring out HEIC→JPG and MOV→MP4 conversion, documented the commands. Generated product details for the new bedsheet using ChatGPT (20 min). Completed initial Razorpay payment setup — test payment successful, real payments enabled (cards only at first). Updated Shopify theme to "whisper."
- **Feb 23 (afternoon)** — Completed full payment setup: UPI, netbanking, and wallets now supported alongside cards (1 hour). Tested the entire order flow — checkout, order, refund — all working. Raised support ticket about showing UPI directly on checkout page. Identified packaging gaps: brown bags too small (returned), label printer needed. Shipping rates and pricing still to be decided.

## Last seen breadcrumbs
- UPI shows on a hosted Razorpay page, not directly on checkout — support ticket raised, waiting for response
- Adding more products and polishing the Shopify site look are the next platform steps
- Product videos need an editor — this may overlap with the SVK YouTube editor search
- Packaging: need correct-size brown bags and a label printer (which could also serve home organization and quick notes)
- Check with nearby DTDC office about shipping rates
- Pricing and shipping charges still need to be decided
- The unboxing video idea and natural-light photoshoot plan are both ready to try
