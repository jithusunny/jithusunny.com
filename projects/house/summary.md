# House

## Story so far
The baby is growing, and the house needs to keep up. It started with one concrete thought: cameras for the kitchen, hall, and bedroom where the baby spends most of his time. A safety and peace-of-mind thing.

By mid-February, the scope grew. A maintenance backlog surfaced: mosquito-proof door gaps, electrician work (LED strip in the kitchen, a plug point for the robocleaner, leaking bathroom pipes, replacement bathroom stands). These are the small things that quietly drain energy when left undone.

Two unused purchases also came into focus. A walking pad that never made it into a daily routine. A wide monitor sitting on the desk, pushing the laptop far enough away to cause eye strain — not earning its space. Both need a decision: use them or get rid of them.

And there's the baby monitoring setup: an iPad that should have ezycam+ installed so anyone in the house can check in on the baby without needing Jithu's phone. Plus an uncle's old iPhone waiting to be reset and returned.

## Timeline
- **Feb 12** — Noted the need to install cameras in the kitchen, hall, and bedroom where the baby spends most time.
- **Feb 19** — Home maintenance backlog surfaced: mosquito doors, electrician work, leaking pipes, bathroom stands. Recognized the walking pad and wide monitor are unused and need decisions. iPad baby monitoring setup identified. Uncle's iPhone needs resetting.

## Last seen breadcrumbs
- The wide monitor situation is the most urgent — it's actively causing eye strain and needs resolution soon
- The electrician work could be batched into one visit — LED strip, plug point, leaks, stands
- Setting up the iPad for baby monitoring is a quick win that helps everyone in the house
- Camera setup for baby rooms is still the original need and hasn't been acted on
