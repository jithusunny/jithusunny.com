# House

## Story so far
The baby is growing, and the house needs to keep up. It started with one concrete thought: cameras for the kitchen, hall, and bedroom where the baby spends most of his time. A safety and peace-of-mind thing.

By mid-February, the scope grew. A maintenance backlog surfaced: mosquito-proof door gaps, electrician work (LED strip in the kitchen, a plug point for the robocleaner, leaking bathroom pipes, replacement bathroom stands). These are the small things that quietly drain energy when left undone.

Two unused purchases also came into focus. A walking pad that never made it into a daily routine. A wide monitor sitting on the desk, pushing the laptop far enough away to cause eye strain — not earning its space. Both need a decision: use them or get rid of them.

And there's the baby monitoring setup: an iPad that should have ezycam+ installed so anyone in the house can check in on the baby without needing Jithu's phone. Plus an uncle's old iPhone waiting to be reset and returned.

The AC got serviced — a technician came and cleaned it. One of those small maintenance events that happen in the background of everything else.

By late February, a deeper shift started. The philosophy of "everything in its own place" became more than a preference — it became a practice. A major decluttering happened: multiple trolleys and bags packed with unused clothes and items, destined for Ollur or to be given away. The principle is clear — keep only what is used and feels good. Reducing stuff is the path to less time spent picking up and organizing, and more peace when looking around the room.

A cleaning schedule was written out — areas of the flat with periodicity (daily, weekly, monthly). And an idea surfaced for a House app: tracking all items in the house and their locations, plus cleaning schedules. Sounds extreme, but it feels necessary.

There's also a gentle push happening toward shared organization with Elsa. Stuff is everywhere, and picking up things and putting them in the right place is taking a lot of time. The only way forward is to reduce, organize, and maintain.

The shutdown ritual is becoming central. Clean up the room before bed. Nothing out of place. Next morning, you see order — and you feel cared for. This connects to a bigger insight: when your environment is clean, you start to like yourself more. The cycle feeds itself.

## Timeline
- **Feb 12** — Noted the need to install cameras in the kitchen, hall, and bedroom where the baby spends most time.
- **Feb 19** — Home maintenance backlog surfaced: mosquito doors, electrician work, leaking pipes, bathroom stands. Recognized the walking pad and wide monitor are unused and need decisions. iPad baby monitoring setup identified. Uncle's iPhone needs resetting. AC serviced by a technician.
- **Feb 24** — Major decluttering: packed trolleys and bags of unused clothes and items for removal. Wrote a cleaning schedule (daily/weekly/monthly per area). Idea for a House app (item tracking + cleaning schedules). Pushing toward shared organization with Elsa. The daily shutdown ritual — clean up before bed — is becoming a core practice.

## Last seen breadcrumbs
- The decluttering momentum is alive — keep going until only what's used and loved remains
- The House app idea (item locations + cleaning schedules) could be a future project or a feature within Project Zero
- The electrician work can still be batched into one visit — LED strip, plug point, leaks, stands
- Setting up the iPad for baby monitoring is a quick win
- The wide monitor and walking pad still need decisions
