# House

## Story so far
The baby is growing, and the house needs to keep up. Right now there's one concrete thing on the mind: cameras. The kitchen, the hall, the bedroom — the rooms where the baby spends most of his time. It's a safety and peace-of-mind thing. The thought surfaced among many others, almost as a demonstration of how project tagging works. But the need is real and hasn't been acted on yet.

## Timeline
- **Feb 12** — Noted the need to install cameras in the kitchen, hall, and bedroom where the baby spends most time.

## Last seen breadcrumbs
- Picking a camera setup (brand, features, budget) is the natural first step
- This project could grow to include other household things over time — it's barely a project right now, more of a placeholder with one honest need
