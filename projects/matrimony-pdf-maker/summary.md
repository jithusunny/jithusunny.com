# Matrimony PDF Maker Summary

## Context
A mobile-first web tool to generate clean matrimony profile PDFs through structured input, with plans for voice AI and document upload in later phases. Built as a static frontend with no backend.

## Highlights
- Created GitHub repo: https://github.com/jithusunny/matrimony-pdf
- Vision and spec defined with ChatGPT: single JSON state, live HTML preview, client-side PDF export, no backend
- Phased roadmap: Phase 1 (living document editor) → Phase 2 (voice AI) → Phase 3 (document upload/import)
- Phase 1 tested — quality was surprisingly good even before adding all remaining fields
- Insight: the concept could generalize to any structured document (bills, invoices, warranties, profiles)
- Potential to build a marketplace where users build and consume document templates (20% builders, 80% consumers)

## Next (could)
Complete Phase 1 by adding remaining fields, or explore generalizing the tool to other structured document types.
