# Jithu — Story so far

## The beginning

I was reading Steven Pressfield's *Do the Work* somewhere in early February and something clicked — not as new information, but as a mirror held up at the right angle. I had too many ideas. I'd been consuming content for years, YouTube especially, and the potential energy inside me had grown enormous. But nothing proportionate was coming out. The ideas stayed inside, circling.

I had resigned from a well-paying job. Family was asking the obvious question: what are you doing? I didn't have a satisfying answer. Not because nothing was happening, but because what was happening was invisible. Thoughts about how to live, how to see clearly, how to stop getting pushed around by the tides of time. None of that is easy to point at.

The realization was simple: waiting for a perfect plan before starting is itself the resistance. The greedy mind wants everything figured out first and ends up doing nothing. So I typed a thought into a plain text file and put it on my website. That was the beginning.

It wasn't a grand launch. It was a single thought, put somewhere public, as proof that something had started. A second followed the same day. The act wasn't about producing content — it was about witnessing. The thoughts were already happening, all the time, chaotically. Most of them repetitive. Writing them down changed them, even slightly. Observation, it turns out, might change what is being observed.

This wasn't about building an app or starting a business. Those things would come, but they were downstream. The root concern was more basic: thoughts are the basis of actions, and actions shape a life. If the thoughts are chaotic and unseen, the life built on them will be too. I wanted to see what was happening in my own mind. Not to control it — maybe that's not possible — but to see it.

## How life is being lived now

The days have a loose rhythm. I wake up, sometimes early. There are morning walks where I talk into my phone, recording whatever comes up. Sometimes it flows. Sometimes it's stilted because people are around, looking at the guy talking to himself. I come home, help with Ian — bathe him, play with him, take him downstairs for some sun. Elsa gets ready for work. I eat, maybe nap if the night was short. Then I sit down and try to do something.

The "something" varies. Some days it's writing. Some days it's setting up Elsa's store. Some days it's just thinking, which looks like nothing from the outside.

I capture whatever comes up as raw text — messy, unstructured, stream-of-consciousness. The mess is the point. From those dumps, smaller pieces get extracted: decisions I've made, things I want to do, tensions I'm feeling, things that actually happened. That extraction used to be manual but it was boring, and I've learned that boring things get abandoned. So I handed it off to AI. I keep the thinking. The filing happens on its own.

There's a new pattern emerging around reference material — plans and guides generated in conversation with AI that aren't my thoughts but are too useful to let vanish in a chat window. They go in docs folders now, near the projects they belong to. They can be deleted without losing anything that came from me. A middle ground.

Time is noticed more carefully now. Four days can vanish and it stings. I've started treating each day as a full cycle — wake up clean, shut down clean, don't carry yesterday's unfinished weight into tomorrow. I watch my energy throughout the day. Don't sit in front of a screen late at night. Don't eat heavy at noon. Go with the grain.

Plans have become suspect. Long todo lists feel like debts imposed by a past self who had different energy and different understanding. I've started preferring stories over plans — here's what happened and why it mattered — and breadcrumbs over roadmaps — here are a few things that seem alive right now, pick one and walk. Like a game where you can only see the nearest path.

Resistance is a daily companion. It shows up as the urge to research one more option, define one more spec, think through one more scenario — before doing anything. The counter-move, when it works, is just to start. The relief that follows action is always disproportionate to the effort.

## Projects as expressions (not goals)

Projects are not goals. They're contexts — places where life energy is flowing, or wants to flow. Some are active. Some are just a single thought, tagged and waiting.

At the center sits the thing I've started calling Project Zero. It's the practice of capturing thoughts, extracting what matters, and organizing it by the areas of life it touches. But it's more than that. It's a way of paying attention — to my mind, to my days, to what keeps pulling me and what keeps resisting. It wants to make itself unnecessary eventually, which is part of what makes it feel right.

Around it, other things orbit. Elsa's boutique business, which I'm helping stand up, because her happiness and energy affect everything in this house. That one has moved fast — from an idea and a domain name to a live Shopify store with a real product, a logo, payment setup in progress, and the first product photos shot on the dining table at night. It's the most tangible proof that things are moving. My father's YouTube channel, which has a working process that could be smoother. A pull toward capturing daily life on video that hasn't been acted on yet but keeps surfacing. A tool I built for someone's matrimony profile that turned into an insight about structured documents in general. Cameras for the rooms where the baby spends his time.

None of these are separate from each other. A morning walk can touch three of them at once. Progress on one often unblocks another. They're not compartments — they're different angles on the same life.

## What keeps repeating

Resistance keeps wearing the mask of planning. I'll research one more tool, define one more spec, think through one more edge case — and call it preparation. The moments of actual progress have always come from interrupting that loop and just starting. Publishing the first thought. Signing up for Shopify. Putting the first product up. The relief afterward is always larger than I expected.

If a process is boring, I will abandon it. I've seen this enough times to stop pretending otherwise. It's not a character flaw — it's a design constraint. The work has to stay interesting, or at least not feel like a chore, or it won't last. Alan Watts said to make it like play. That keeps proving true.

Small visible results unlock energy for everything else. The first thought published, a store taking shape, a surprisingly good PDF preview, a live site with one product that actually looks good — each one creates momentum. The absence of visible results drains it. This is why the fear of "all thinking, no output" is not irrational. It's a signal.

Most of what runs through my mind on any given day already ran through it yesterday. Writing it down makes the loops visible. And seeing them — just seeing them — seems to loosen their grip slightly.

Todo lists from three days ago feel like someone else's orders. The context has shifted. Rigid plans from the past don't account for what I know now. Stories and breadcrumbs age better than task lists.

And family is not separate from the work. Elsa's mood, Ian's needs, the state of the house — these are not interruptions. Mridhu exists because Elsa's happiness matters. Morning walks happen partly because the body needs movement and partly because that's when thoughts flow best. It's all one fabric.

## Where things feel unresolved

There is a tension between inner work and visible output. The thought-tracking, the observation — it feels important internally. But from the outside, it looks like nothing is happening. Family asks. The inner critic asks. *Show me proof.* How much inner work is enough before something needs to ship?

There is a question about how public this should be. The raw thoughts are on a public website, but private things are being withheld. The deeper question isn't technical — it's about vulnerability. How much of the mess is worth showing? Who is this for?

There is an uncertainty about structure. Too little, and the days dissolve into nothing. Too much, and it becomes a cage. The approach so far has been to add structure only when its absence causes real pain, and to remove it the moment it feels artificial. But where that line sits keeps shifting.

There is the question of money. A well-paying job was left behind. Nothing generates income yet. The freedom to do all of this depends on resources being drawn down, not replenished. It hasn't become urgent, but it's there.

And there is the recurring doubt about whether any of this will actually lead somewhere. Or whether it's an elaborate way of staying busy without producing anything. The answer so far has been to keep going and see. Failure only exists when you declare it and stop.

## Last seen breadcrumbs

- Elsa's store is live with one product — natural-light photos, a working payment flow, and a second product could make it real
- There might be a short piece of writing somewhere in all these captured thoughts that's worth showing to someone
- The morning walk recordings are already happening — adding video would be the smallest possible step toward that channel that keeps pulling
- The story is now on the home page, which means anyone who visits can see what this is about for the first time
- A way to zoom in and out on the story — more detail, less detail — keeps coming to mind
