# Jithu — Story so far

## The beginning

Somewhere in early February 2026, Jithu was reading Steven Pressfield's *Do the Work* and something clicked — not as new information, but as a mirror held up at the right angle. He had too many ideas. He had been consuming content for years, YouTube especially, and the potential energy inside him had grown enormous. But the output hadn't kept pace. There was no proportionate creation happening. The ideas stayed inside, circling.

He had resigned from a well-paying job. Family — parents, sister, in-laws — were asking the obvious question: what are you doing? He didn't have a satisfying answer. Not because nothing was happening, but because what was happening was invisible. It was all internal. Thoughts about systems, about life, about how to live with clarity instead of being pushed around by the tides of time. None of that is easy to point at.

The realization that hit was this: waiting for a perfect plan before starting is itself the resistance. It's the thing Pressfield warns about. The greedy mind wants to do many things, wants them all figured out first, and ends up doing nothing. So Jithu typed a thought into a plain text file and published it on jithusunny.com. That was the beginning.

It wasn't a grand launch. It was a single thought, put somewhere public, as proof that something had started. A second thought followed the same day. The act of writing wasn't about producing content — it was about witnessing. The thoughts were already happening, all the time, chaotically. Most of them were repetitive. Writing them down changed them, even slightly. Observation, it turns out, might change what is being observed.

This was not about building an app or starting a business. Those things would come, but they were downstream. The root concern was more fundamental: thoughts are the basis of actions, and actions shape a life. If the thoughts are chaotic, unseen, unexamined, the life built on them will be too. Jithu wanted to see clearly what was going on in his own mind. Not to control it — maybe that's not possible — but to see it.

## How life is being lived now

The days have a loose rhythm. Jithu wakes up, sometimes early — 5:30 on a good day. There are morning walks where he talks into his phone, recording whatever comes up. Sometimes it flows. Sometimes it's stilted and self-conscious because people are around, looking at the guy talking to himself. He comes home, helps with the baby — Ian — bathes him, plays with him, takes him downstairs for some sun. Elsa gets ready for work. He eats, maybe naps if the night was short. Then he sits down and tries to do something.

The "something" varies. Some days it's writing raw thoughts. Some days it's setting up a Shopify store. Some days it's wrestling with transcription tools. Some days it's just thinking, which looks like nothing from the outside.

Raw thoughts get captured as plain text files — one file per session, named by the minute it started: `raw/2026/02/17/0747.txt`. No formatting, no structure imposed. Whatever comes out, comes out. The mess is the point. These files are immutable — once written, never edited. Everything built on top of them is derived, never embedded.

From these raw dumps, atomic thoughts get extracted: self-contained observations, decisions, intentions, tensions. Each one tagged lightly and filed by project. Events too — factual things that happened. The extraction is done by AI now, following rules that Jithu defined. He tried doing it manually and found it boring. Boring things get abandoned. That's not laziness — it's a pattern he's learned to respect rather than fight.

Time is noticed more carefully these days. Four days can vanish without progress and it stings. The day is treated as the unit of life — born at sunrise, die at sunset. The goal, if there is one, is to shut down each night with nothing half-finished weighing on the heart, and to wake up without carrying yesterday's mistakes forward. Energy levels throughout the day are watched: don't sit in front of a screen late at night, don't eat heavy at noon if you want a clear afternoon. Go with the grain.

Plans have become suspect. Long todo lists feel like liabilities — debts imposed by a past self on a future self who might have different energy, different insight. Instead, the preference is for stories and breadcrumbs. Show the past as a narrative — what happened and why it mattered. Show the future as a few gentle next steps, like a game where you can only see the nearest path, not the whole map. Pick one and walk.

Resistance is a daily companion. It shows up as analysis-paralysis, as the urge to research one more option, as the voice that says *this is not practical* or *people will laugh*. Pressfield's name for it stuck. The counter-move, when it works, is simply to do something — anything that's in the right direction and doesn't require too much planning. The relief that follows action is real and immediate. It has been felt more than once.

## Projects as expressions (not goals)

Projects are not goals in the way a company might define them. They are contexts — areas where life energy is currently flowing, or wants to flow. Some are active. Some are just a single thought, tagged and waiting.

Project Zero sits at the center. It is the meta-project — the system that captures thoughts, extracts meaning, organizes by project, and eventually aims to automate parts of the process. It is also the philosophy: a way of living with clarity, which aims to make itself unnecessary once clarity is found. A system that wants to self-destruct.

Mridhu is Elsa's boutique business, and supporting it is not optional — Elsa's happiness and energy are tied to its progress, and that affects the whole household. Setting up the Shopify store, figuring out payments when Stripe doesn't work in India, planning product photos with a gimbal and an iPhone — these are acts of care as much as acts of commerce.

SVK English Classes is the father's YouTube channel, with an existing workflow that works but has friction. The desire to simplify it sits quietly alongside everything else.

The personal YouTube channel doesn't exist yet. It lives as a pull — a recurring attraction toward capturing daily life on video, treating each day as a rebirth. The morning walk audio recordings are already a kind of prototype.

The matrimony PDF maker started because someone needed a profile made, and it turned into a tool, and the tool turned into an insight about structured documents in general. It may grow or it may not.

The house project has one item: cameras for the rooms where the baby spends his time. It's barely a project. But the need is real.

None of these are separate from each other. Progress on one often enables progress on another. The video pipeline for SVK could work for the personal channel. The project view built for Project Zero applies to Mridhu. The thinking done during a morning walk touches three projects at once. They are not compartments — they are different angles on the same life.

Tools and systems serve this, not the other way around. Shopify was chosen because building a custom store was a distraction. AssemblyAI was chosen because it produced readable transcripts. Make.com was chosen for automation with the explicit rule: use it until it annoys you, then switch. Nothing is permanent. Nothing is precious. The work matters, the tools don't.

## What keeps repeating

Some patterns have shown up enough times to be worth naming.

**Resistance wears the mask of planning.** The urge to research one more tool, define one more spec, think through one more scenario — before doing anything. It feels productive. It isn't. The moments of actual progress have come from interrupting this loop and just starting. Publishing the first thought. Buying the recorder. Signing up for Shopify. The relief after action is always disproportionate to the effort.

**Boredom is a death sentence for systems.** If a process is boring, it will be abandoned. This is not a flaw to fix — it's a constraint to design around. Manual extraction of thoughts was boring, so AI does it now. If the morning recordings become a chore, they'll stop. The work has to be enjoyable, or at least interesting, or it won't last. Alan Watts said to make it like play. That keeps proving true.

**Joy unlocks momentum, and momentum is everything.** A small visible result — the first thought published, a Shopify store taking shape, a surprisingly good PDF preview — creates energy for the next thing. The absence of visible results drains energy. This is why the fear of "all thinking, no output" is not irrational. It's a signal that something needs to become visible soon.

**Thoughts are mostly repetitive.** Around 80% of what runs through the mind on a given day already ran through it yesterday. Noting thoughts down makes this visible. The loops become apparent. And seeing them — just seeing them — seems to loosen their grip slightly.

**The past self is not a trustworthy manager.** Todo lists created three days ago feel like someone else's orders. The context has shifted, the energy is different, the understanding has deepened. Rigid plans from the past don't account for what the present self knows. Stories and breadcrumbs age better than task lists.

**Family is not separate from the work.** Elsa's mood, Ian's needs, the state of the house — these are not interruptions to the "real work." They are the real work. Mridhu exists because Elsa's happiness matters. The house project exists because the baby is growing. Morning walks happen partly because the body needs movement and partly because that's when thoughts flow best. It's all one fabric.

## Where things feel unresolved

There is a tension between inner work and visible output. The thought-tracking, the observation, the philosophy — it all feels important internally. But from the outside, it looks like nothing is happening. Family asks questions. The inner critic asks questions. *Show me proof. Show, don't tell.* The tension is real and unresolved. How much inner work is enough before something needs to ship?

There is a question about how public this life should be. The raw thoughts are on a public website, but private things are being withheld. Eventually there will need to be a way to mark things as private. But the deeper question isn't technical — it's about vulnerability. How much of the mess is worth showing? Who is this for?

There is an uncertainty about structure. Too little, and the days dissolve into nothing. Too much, and it becomes a cage — another system that controls rather than serves. The current approach is to add structure only when the lack of it causes real pain, and to remove structure the moment it feels artificial. But where that line sits keeps shifting.

There is the question of money. A well-paying job was left behind. Projects are underway, but none of them generate income yet. Positive cash flow matters — not in the abstract, but concretely. The freedom to do all of this depends on resources that are being drawn down, not replenished. This hasn't become urgent yet, but it's there, in the background.

There is the recurring doubt about whether this whole approach — raw thoughts, atomic extraction, project views, breadcrumbs — will actually lead somewhere. Or whether it's an elaborate way of staying busy without producing anything. The answer so far has been to keep going and see. Failure only exists when you declare it and stop.

## Last seen breadcrumbs

- The Mridhu Shopify store is almost functional — products, photos, and a real payment test are close
- A first blog post derived from extracted thoughts could be the simplest visible artifact for Project Zero
- The morning walk recordings are already happening — adding video to one of them would start the YouTube channel with zero extra planning
- The common project view (what happened, what is happening, what could happen) keeps being described but hasn't been built yet
- The matrimony PDF maker's generalization insight is sitting untested — a second document type would prove or disprove it
- Somewhere in all these atoms and events, there might be a short piece of writing that's worth showing to someone
