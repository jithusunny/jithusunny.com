      Happy to see jithusunny.com with the first thought.
    </div>

    <div class="m" id="1770358863" title="1770358863">
      Having done a lot of thinking about the various things I want to do and the various ways I can do things, etc., etc.
    </div>

    <div class="m" id="1770358866" title="1770358866">
      I want to give the planner part of me some rest and let the doer part do something.
    </div>

    <div class="m" id="1770358869" title="1770358869">
      So here's the second thought - let's decrease the load on planning side and start doing some things.

    <div class="m" id="1770358872" title="1770358872">
      Let's publish this second thought.

    <div class="m" id="1770359163" title="1770359163">
      Now let's see what else is popping up in my head...
    </div>

    <div class="m" id="1770359166" title="1770359166">
      There needs to be a place where I can crystallize and keep certain thoughts, and treat them like rules/guidance.
    </div>

    <div class="m" id="1770359169" title="1770359169">
      For example, one thought that I'm getting is this.
    </div>

    <div class="m" id="1770359172" title="1770359172">
      Writing a lot is fun, the flow is important.
    </div>

    <div class="m" id="1770359175" title="1770359175">
      The fluidity in expression is as important as expressing itself.
    </div>

    <div class="m" id="1770359178" title="1770359178">
      One thing that I tend to not like a lot is rework.
    </div>

    <div class="m" id="1770359181" title="1770359181">
      When I have to do work that is not really so efficient and is a bit boring, etc., I tend to not do that after the second or third time.
    </div>

    <div class="m" id="1770359184" title="1770359184">
      Every time I do something I must be able to mindfully do it.
    </div>

    <div class="m" id="1770359187" title="1770359187">
      I think monks who have practiced mindfulness and some people who by nature are mindful, etc., can do the exact same thing mindfully till they die.
    </div>

    <div class="m" id="1770359190" title="1770359190">
      I guess I'm not that person, and my life's predicament is not to become a monk either.
    </div>

    <div class="m" id="1770359193" title="1770359193">
      Though I often thought I would become a monk, it was a status thing I was chasing till sometime back.
    </div>

    <div class="m" id="1770359196" title="1770359196">
      And that is not completely out of the picture either.
    </div>

    <div class="m" id="1770359199" title="1770359199">
      Still I'm pulled to a life that is minimal, paying attention to attention itself, etc.
    </div>

    <div class="m" id="1770359202" title="1770359202">
      See I go into the story mode often.
    </div>

    <div class="m" id="1770359205" title="1770359205">
      What I was starting to describe is the thought that some rules/guidance can be extracted from all of the thoughts I'm having.
    </div>

    <div class="m" id="1770359208" title="1770359208">
      One such rule is, set the initial configuration, set the rules of evolution/causality and rest.
    </div>

    <div class="m" id="1770359211" title="1770359211">
      As I kept typing this, something came to my mind - almost gave me goosebumps.
    </div>

    <div class="m" id="1770359214" title="1770359214">
      I can call this the bigbang method or something.
    </div>

    <div class="m" id="1770359217" title="1770359217">
      The initial configuration once set, the next levels are deterministically generated from that following the universal laws/rules, etc.
    </div>

    <div class="m" id="1770359220" title="1770359220">
      And we can keep refining the initial config and the rules/evolution/process thing again and again.
    </div>

    <div class="m" id="1770359223" title="1770359223">
      But we don't interfere in between.
    </div>

    <div class="m" id="1770359226" title="1770359226">
      We do the creation part and start the thing - it goes on, but we take rest.
    </div>

    <div class="m" id="1770359229" title="1770359229">
      Isn't this similar to the creation story in Bible?!
    </div>

    <div class="m" id="1770359232" title="1770359232">
      Like God taking rest after creation? :)
    </div>

    <div class="m" id="1770359235" title="1770359235">
      Wow, I'm actually smiling now!
    </div>

    <div class="m" id="1770359238" title="1770359238">
      I feel like God.
    </div>

    <div class="m" id="1770359241" title="1770359241">
      It may be the case that this is the 1972656th execution of the thing.
    </div>

    <div class="m" id="1770359244" title="1770359244">
      i.e., God setup the initial config, setup the rules of the game and everything and hit 'Start' so it went bang!
    </div>

    <div class="m" id="1770359247" title="1770359247">
      Now this is part thought, part imagination.
    </div>

    <div class="m" id="1770359250" title="1770359250">
      Now I'm actively imagining as well.
    </div>

    <div class="m" id="1770359253" title="1770359253">
      I had this thought that I wanted to capture, but then this imagination/story thing came in between and it is so irresistible that I'm pursuing that to some length and will come back.
    </div>

    <div class="m" id="1770359256" title="1770359256">
      Feeling like Bindhu Panicker in the movie CID Moosa.
    </div>

    <div class="m" id="1770359259" title="1770359259">
      So God hit "Go", and is watching everything, hopefully.
    </div>

    <div class="m" id="1770359262" title="1770359262">
      And in the next run God will tweak the initial config and the rules/evolution/process or whatever so that bugs/limitations/issues are fixed as much as possible.
    </div>

    <div class="m" id="1770359265" title="1770359265">
      This includes as many why-did-god-let-this-happen complaints as well.
    </div>

    <div class="m" id="1770359268" title="1770359268">
      There's more to it - I don't think there are any reasonable complaints ever, anywhere.
    </div>

    <div class="m" id="1770359271" title="1770359271">
      It is rare to get this point of view clearly.
    </div>

    <div class="m" id="1770359274" title="1770359274">
      There is a reasonable, if not infinite, amount of divinity and potential in each of us, I believe.
    </div>

    <div class="m" id="1770359277" title="1770359277">
      More about that later.
    </div>

    <div class="m" id="1770359280" title="1770359280">
      The point about that was - we have the ability and potential to fix any issue, solve any problem, face any challenge and do anything we want to do.
    </div>

    <div class="m" id="1770359283" title="1770359283">
      That is definitely incredible to believe, and honestly I myself don't believe it most of the times.
    </div>

    <div class="m" id="1770359286" title="1770359286">
      But in a certain point of view that has some truth in it, I do feel.
    </div>

    <div class="m" id="1770359289" title="1770359289">
      So going back to the imagination about God and all this - God will not interfere until the big crunch, for example.
    </div>

    <div class="m" id="1770359292" title="1770359292">
      My thought is this way of operating is really God level - not boring, easy (in the long run), non-messy, fun way of creating.
    </div>

    <div class="m" id="1770359295" title="1770359295">
      Now I'm starting to actually doubt - is all this really the 1972656th execution of some God's setup?!
    </div>

    <div class="m" id="1770359298" title="1770359298">
      Now that was too much bla bla, and no doing at all.
    </div>

    <div class="m" id="1770360312" title="1770360312">
      I want the raw thing to be captured and then see the different things separately, clearly, but interlinked as suitable.

    <div class="m" id="1770360324" title="1770360324">
      So basically I will soon grow this into something where I connect my raw thoughts to, and it will be the raw/truth captured that is the base of everything.

    <div class="m" id="1770360327" title="1770360327">
      I’m not sure if an event happened (e.g., I brushed my teeth) should also be a thought or should be captured as an event?
    </div>

    <div class="m" id="1770360330" title="1770360330">
      It might be good for uniformity’s sake if we keep everything a thought.

    <div class="m" id="1770360333" title="1770360333">
      Or maybe having events separate from thoughts is better.

    <div class="m" id="1770360336" title="1770360336">
