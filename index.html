    Reading Steven Pressfield's Do the Work.
    He says stuff that makes sense to me.
    My current state is, I have so many things in my head and I'm putting away the work.
    I want a perfect plan before I can start. But I'm greedy and want to do so many things.
    So many things most of which are radically different to what is around.
    
    So I'm starting.
    
    Putting this simple text which is the thought I'm having right now on my website.

    Happy to see jithusunny.com with the first thought.

    Having done a lot of thinking about the various things I want to do and the various ways I can do things, etc, etc. I want to give the planner part of me some rest and let the doer part do something.
    So here's the second thought - let's decrease the load on planning side and start doing some things.
    Let's publish this second thought.
