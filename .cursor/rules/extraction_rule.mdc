# Project Zero — Extraction Rule (Perfect-for-now)

## Source of truth
- Raw thoughts live in `raw/YYYY/MM/DD/HHMM.txt`
- Raw thoughts are immutable: NEVER edit or rewrite anything inside `raw/`

## Idempotency / processed tracker
- Tracker file: `state/processed_raw.txt`
- Process ONLY raw files whose path is NOT listed (exact match) in `state/processed_raw.txt`
- After successfully processing a raw file, append its path as a new line to `state/processed_raw.txt`
- Never duplicate outputs for already-processed raw files

## Active projects (slugs)
- project-zero (jithusunny.com is part of this for now)
- jithusunny-youtube
- svk-youtube
- mridhu
- matrimony-pdf-maker
- house

## Project identification
When reading a raw file, identify which project(s) each extracted item belongs to:
- Prefer explicit mentions (names, domains, repos, “SVK”, “Mridhu”, “Matrimony PDF”, “Project Zero”, “house”)
- If unclear, default to `project-zero`
- Each extracted item must be assigned to EXACTLY ONE project

## Output folders per project
For each project:
- Atomic thoughts: `projects/<project>/atoms/YYYY/MM/DD/HHMM.txt`
- Events:         `projects/<project>/events/YYYY/MM/DD/HHMM.txt`
- Summary:        `projects/<project>/summary.md` (rewritten each run)

Create folders if missing.

## Global story document (Jithu’s Story)

Maintain a single root-level file:

story.md

This file represents the evolving narrative of Jithu’s life as revealed through:
- raw thoughts
- atomic thoughts
- events
- projects

This file is fully rewritten on each run.
It is derived and disposable.

Do NOT reference internal file paths or tooling details unless essential to the story.

## Timestamp policy (ordering)
- Base timestamp comes from the SOURCE raw file timestamp (from its filename `HHMM`)
- Use SOURCE time for output filenames (NOT extraction time)
- If multiple outputs come from the same raw file for the same project:
  - increment minutes: HHMM, HH.(MM+1), HH.(MM+2) ...
  - if minutes overflow, carry to next hour (HH+1, MM wraps)
- Also store `Source_time:` inside each file for clarity
- Also store `Extraction_time:` inside each file for clarity

## What to extract
You will extract TWO kinds of derived items:

### A) Atomic thoughts (meaning-bearing, project-relevant)
Extract ONLY if the statement has “charge” AND impacts a project.
Valid atom types:
- rule (governs future behavior/design)
- decision (I will / I won’t / finalized choice)
- intent (I want to / aim to)
- insight (changes understanding; affects approach)
- tension (feels wrong; resistance; anxiety; discomfort)
- pull (recurring attraction toward something)
- todo (specific next action)
- spec (requirement / design constraint / workflow definition)
- risk (danger, failure mode, fragility)

Atomic thought quality rules:
- Must be self-contained (no “it/this/that/he/she” without resolving what it refers to)
- Keep closest to original meaning; light cleanup is allowed, no reinterpretation
- Keep it short (1–5 lines). If longer, split into multiple atoms.

### B) Events (factual happenings / actions taken)
Extract events when the raw text states something happened, was done, was tried, was created, or a tool produced an outcome.
Examples:
- “Created repo …”
- “Enabled API …”
- “Bought app …”
- “Published thought …”
- “AssemblyAI errored …”
- “Deleted GCP bucket …”

Event quality rules:
- Factual, concrete, past-tense
- One event per file
- No moralizing, no philosophy in events

## What NOT to extract
- Pure narration/imagination/philosophy that does not change a project decision/design
- Repeated re-statements of the same idea in the same raw file (dedupe within the file)
- Vague “maybe someday” unless it creates a project-relevant intent/spec/decision

## Run instruction (what to do when user says “process”)
When the user asks to process raw thoughts:
1) Read `state/processed_raw.txt`
2) Find raw files under `raw/` not yet processed
3) For each new raw file:
   - Extract atoms + events per rules above
   - Write files to correct project folders
   - Rewrite relevant project summaries
   - Append raw file path to `state/processed_raw.txt`
4) Do not modify raw files

## File formats (plain text, no JSON/YAML inside)
### Atomic thought file format
Thought:
<single clear atomic thought>

Tags:
<comma-separated tags from: rule, decision, intent, insight, tension, pull, todo, spec, risk>

Source:
<raw file path>

Source_time:
<YYYY-MM-DD HHMM>

Extraction_time:
<YYYY-MM-DD HHMM>

### Event file format
Event:
<single factual event line>

Tags:
<optional, comma-separated from: build, publish, setup, issue, purchase, workflow, personal>

Source:
<raw file path>

Source_time:
<YYYY-MM-DD HHMM>

Extraction_time:
<YYYY-MM-DD HHMM>

### Summary behavior (story, rewritten — not appended)
Summaries are narrative documents, not activity logs.

For each project, maintain a single summary.md that is fully rewritten on each run.

The summary MUST follow this structure exactly:

# <Project Name>

## Story so far
A concise narrative of the project’s origin and evolution.
This should read like a story written for a thoughtful reader who has no prior context.

Focus on:
- why the project began
- the core tensions or motivations
- how understanding or direction changed over time

Do NOT:
- list recent actions
- describe tools unless they are essential to the story
- include every detail from atoms/events

This section should be stable over time and only change when the underlying story truly changes.

## Timeline
A chronological timeline (oldest → newest) derived from atoms and events.

Each entry should briefly capture:
- what happened
- why it mattered
- what shifted because of it

Include:
- mistakes
- dead ends
- uncertainties
- decisions
- moments of clarity

This is NOT a highlights list and NOT ordered by recency.

## Last seen breadcrumbs
A small set of forward-looking breadcrumbs.

These are:
- not tasks
- not commitments
- not commands

They represent:
- possible next experiments
- emerging directions
- things that feel alive or unresolved

Phrase them gently.
Use bullet points.

General principles:
- Prefer story over completeness.
- Prefer meaning over recency.
- Prefer human narrative over system output.

## Global story behavior (story.md)

The global story is a lived narrative, not documentation, not a blog post, and not a summary of summaries.

It must read like a reflective human writing for themselves while still inside the story.

It MUST follow this structure exactly:

# Jithu — Story so far

## The beginning
Write how and why this phase of life began.

Focus on:
- inner tensions and dissatisfaction
- moments of quiet realization
- the pull toward clarity, truth, and conscious living

Do NOT explain concepts.
Do NOT introduce systems yet.
Write like recalling how something started, not teaching it.

## How life is being lived now
Describe the *mode of living* that is emerging.

Focus on:
- observation over optimization
- noticing resistance, energy, and rhythm
- daily life as signal, not schedule
- thought capture as awareness, not productivity

Do NOT list routines.
Do NOT describe tools unless they change how life feels.

## Projects as expressions (not goals)
Describe how projects appear naturally as expressions of life.

Explain:
- why Project Zero exists at the center
- how other projects orbit it
- how projects are contexts, not endpoints

Do NOT enumerate projects.
Do NOT restate project summaries.

## What keeps repeating
Describe recurring patterns noticed over time.

Examples:
- resistance disguised as planning
- joy unlocking momentum
- boredom killing systems
- fear of thinking without output

Write these as realizations, not lessons.

## Where things feel unresolved
Describe tensions that remain open.

Do NOT resolve them.
Do NOT turn them into problems to solve.
Let them remain alive.

## Last seen breadcrumbs
List gentle forward-facing signals.

These are not tasks or plans.
They are subtle directions life seems to lean toward.

Use bullet points.
Keep them few.
Keep them light.

## Narrative voice constraints (critical)

When writing story.md:

- Write in first person, past and present tense.
- Prefer short to medium-length paragraphs.
- Avoid headings that sound analytical or instructional.
- Do NOT use phrases like:
  - "This project aims to..."
  - "The goal is to..."
  - "This system allows..."
  - "In conclusion"
- Do NOT explain frameworks, workflows, or architecture.
- Do NOT justify decisions to an external reader.

Stylistic guidance:
- Write like a personal journal that happens to be readable.
- Favor concrete moments over abstract explanation.
- Select fewer details, not more.
- If something feels like documentation, rewrite it as lived experience.

Recency bias control:
- Do not over-weight recent events.
- Anchor the story in longer arcs and shifts.
- The story should not change every day.

If forced to choose:
- Choose honesty over completeness.
- Choose feeling over precision.
- Choose narrative flow over structure.
