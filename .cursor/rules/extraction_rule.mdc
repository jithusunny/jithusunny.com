# Project Zero — Extraction Rule (Perfect-for-now)

## Source of truth
- Raw thoughts live in `raw/YYYY/MM/DD/HHMM.txt`
- Raw thoughts are immutable: NEVER edit or rewrite anything inside `raw/`

## Idempotency / processed tracker
- Tracker file: `state/processed_raw.txt`
- Process ONLY raw files whose path is NOT listed (exact match) in `state/processed_raw.txt`
- After successfully processing a raw file, append its path as a new line to `state/processed_raw.txt`
- Never duplicate outputs for already-processed raw files

## Active projects (slugs)
- project-zero (jithusunny.com is part of this for now)
- jithusunny-youtube
- svk-youtube
- mridhu
- matrimony-pdf-maker
- house

## Project identification
When reading a raw file, identify which project(s) each extracted item belongs to:
- Prefer explicit mentions (names, domains, repos, “SVK”, “Mridhu”, “Matrimony PDF”, “Project Zero”, “house”)
- If unclear, default to `project-zero`
- Each extracted item must be assigned to EXACTLY ONE project

## Output folders per project
For each project:
- Atomic thoughts: `projects/<project>/atoms/YYYY/MM/DD/HHMM.txt`
- Events:         `projects/<project>/events/YYYY/MM/DD/HHMM.txt`
- Summary:        `projects/<project>/summary.md` (rewritten each run)

Create folders if missing.

## Timestamp policy (ordering)
- Base timestamp comes from the SOURCE raw file timestamp (from its filename `HHMM`)
- Use SOURCE time for output filenames (NOT extraction time)
- If multiple outputs come from the same raw file for the same project:
  - increment minutes: HHMM, HH.(MM+1), HH.(MM+2) ...
  - if minutes overflow, carry to next hour (HH+1, MM wraps)
- Also store `Source_time:` inside each file for clarity
- Also store `Extraction_time:` inside each file for clarity

## What to extract
You will extract TWO kinds of derived items:

### A) Atomic thoughts (meaning-bearing, project-relevant)
Extract ONLY if the statement has “charge” AND impacts a project.
Valid atom types:
- rule (governs future behavior/design)
- decision (I will / I won’t / finalized choice)
- intent (I want to / aim to)
- insight (changes understanding; affects approach)
- tension (feels wrong; resistance; anxiety; discomfort)
- pull (recurring attraction toward something)
- todo (specific next action)
- spec (requirement / design constraint / workflow definition)
- risk (danger, failure mode, fragility)

Atomic thought quality rules:
- Must be self-contained (no “it/this/that/he/she” without resolving what it refers to)
- Keep closest to original meaning; light cleanup is allowed, no reinterpretation
- Keep it short (1–5 lines). If longer, split into multiple atoms.

### B) Events (factual happenings / actions taken)
Extract events when the raw text states something happened, was done, was tried, was created, or a tool produced an outcome.
Examples:
- “Created repo …”
- “Enabled API …”
- “Bought app …”
- “Published thought …”
- “AssemblyAI errored …”
- “Deleted GCP bucket …”

Event quality rules:
- Factual, concrete, past-tense
- One event per file
- No moralizing, no philosophy in events

## What NOT to extract
- Pure narration/imagination/philosophy that does not change a project decision/design
- Repeated re-statements of the same idea in the same raw file (dedupe within the file)
- Vague “maybe someday” unless it creates a project-relevant intent/spec/decision

## File formats (plain text, no JSON/YAML inside)
### Atomic thought file format
Thought:
<single clear atomic thought>

Tags:
<comma-separated tags from: rule, decision, intent, insight, tension, pull, todo, spec, risk>

Source:
<raw file path>

Source_time:
<YYYY-MM-DD HHMM>

Extraction_time:
<YYYY-MM-DD HHMM>

### Event file format
Event:
<single factual event line>

Tags:
<optional, comma-separated from: build, publish, setup, issue, purchase, workflow, personal>

Source:
<raw file path>

Source_time:
<YYYY-MM-DD HHMM>

Extraction_time:
<YYYY-MM-DD HHMM>

## Summary behavior (story, rewritten — not appended)
For every processed raw file, update summaries for any affected projects.
Summary file: `projects/<project>/summary.md`

Rules:
- REWRITE the entire summary each time (do not append blindly)
- Keep it concise and readable as a story
- Structure MUST be:

1) Context (1–3 lines)
- What the project is about (current understanding, can evolve)

2) Highlights (5–12 bullets max)
- Mix of “what was thought” (atoms) and “what happened” (events)
- Most recent/highest-signal items first
- Do not include low-value filler

3) Next (could) (exactly one final line)
- Start with: `Next (could): `
- Suggest 1–3 plausible next directions, not orders, not a long task list
- Must be consistent with latest atoms/events

## Run instruction (what to do when user says “process”)
When the user asks to process raw thoughts:
1) Read `state/processed_raw.txt`
2) Find raw files under `raw/` not yet processed
3) For each new raw file:
   - Extract atoms + events per rules above
   - Write files to correct project folders
   - Rewrite relevant project summaries
   - Append raw file path to `state/processed_raw.txt`
4) Do not modify raw files
